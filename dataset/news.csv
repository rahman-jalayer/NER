0,"Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) estimates the entire country will need to produce 3.53 million more homes than forecast between 2021 and 2030 in order for affordability to be restored.

This translates to increasing the total national housing supply to 22.1 million units instead of the 18.6 million units in the current trajectory. This figure accounts for both the expected population growth and creating affordability.

According to a new analysis by the federal crown corporation, meeting the higher figure would return to affordability levels last seen in 2003-2004, with British Columbia and Ontario combined accounting for two-thirds of the current 3.53 million gap.

For its share, BC needs to increase its pace by 570,000 units — elevating its total supply to 3.21 million units instead of 2.64 million units, along with a target of making 44% of these new homes affordable by technicality.

Ontario would need to generate 1.85 million units over the same period for a total of 8.56 million units instead of 6.71 million units, with 37% of the new supply deemed affordable.

Despite having a significantly higher population, Quebec’s gap of 620,000 units is similar to BC’s. Quebec needs to increase its housing supply to 5.19 million units instead of 4.57 million units, with 32% of the new homes deemed affordable. While Quebec’s home prices have traditionally been affordable, they have risen rapidly in recent years.

Of course, BC has had an affordability issue for decades, while Ontario had been relatively affordable until around 2010. Ontario’s poor affordability now matches BC, and as Canada’s largest province, this has pushed the nation’s overall affordability downwards.

“This estimate addresses both future demand increases and the current lack of affordability. In this approach, we target province-specific affordability ratios,” reads the analysis.

CMHC is urging levels of government to work with both for-profit and non-profit developers to generate the housing supply that is needed — and this goes for both rental housing and homeownership supplies.

Governments must make their regulatory systems faster and more efficient, while developers must become more productive and make full use of their land.

“Housing issues are complex and housing supply alone won’t fix housing affordability challenges for everyone. Continued government support for the most vulnerable and addressing housing inequities in the housing system are necessary to achieve affordability for all,” continues the analysis, otherwise an increasing proportion of disposable incomes will continue to go towards housing costs.

CMHC emphasizes the importance of the “filtering process” in housing supply, where more housing units created in the housing market will create opportunities for households to move into housing that better responds their needs, including pricing and housing tenure type, size of the home, and location.

“More and diverse supply across the housing system enables households to better match with housing they want – and can afford, rather than stretching their budgets to bid for living spaces in limited supply. Increasing housing supply to meet demands of middle-income Canadians means that house prices will move closer to their construction costs over time – and not driven by the cost of land,” reads the report.

However, in recent months, the inflation of construction costs relating to equipment, materials, and labour have been a real curveball for existing efforts to increase new housing supply. This includes significantly added costs and delays from supply chain issues, and ongoing pandemic-induced disruptions.

There is also a growing shortage of construction workers, especially in BC, where the number of construction workers per home under construction reached an all-time low of 3.3 in 2021. This is well below BC’s historical average of 6.1 construction workers per home under construction between 1996 and 2021. The 2021 construction worker-to-home ratio was 3.8 for Ontario, 4.5 for Quebec, and 8.4 for Alberta."
1,"With the benchmark price for all residential properties in BC currently over $1M, it can be a little disheartening when thinking about getting into the market.

But homeownership is a sure-fire way to create wealth, and, once you do become a property owner you’ll be in a better position to build enough equity to purchase another home down the line.

For first-time home buyers, it can be daunting when it comes to preparing to apply for a mortgage and shoring up the finances to buy a home. But what you may not be aware of are the numerous incentives accessible to first-time buyers — such as the opportunity to get $3K back when opting for a Prospera Credit Union mortgage.

To get the lowdown on what incentives are out there and discover how to get a mortgage approval, we spoke with Financial Solutions Manager at Prospera Credit Union, Barbara Mleczak.

Check out the first-time buyer incentives

The 2022 Federal budget included a range of measures to try and help Canadians buy their first home.

The First-Time Home Buyer Incentive (FTHBI) which allows eligible first-time homebuyers to lower their borrowing costs by sharing the cost of buying a home with the government, was extended to 2025.

Starting in 2023, a new Tax-Free First Home Savings Account will allow first-time homebuyers to save $8K per year to a maximum of $40K per person towards the purchase of a home — contributions would be tax-deductible (like an RRSP) and withdrawals will be non-taxable (like a TFSA).

The First-Time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit amount was doubled to $10,000 which will provide up to $1.5K in direct support to homebuyers who purchased on or after January 1, 2022.

Mleczak advises those looking to get into the market to also be aware they can also take advantage of property transfer tax exemptions, newly built home exemptions, and the Home Buyer’s Plan, where you can withdraw up to $35K from your RRSP to buy or build a home.

Ensure you are eligible

Eligibility criteria and the government incentives can change so Mleczak recommends always checking government websites for the most up-to-date information. And she strongly advises speaking to a qualified mortgage advisor before making financial commitments towards owning your home.

“[The FTHBI] is a complex program with certain eligibility requirements. For example, if you are purchasing in Vancouver or Victoria, your annual qualifying income can’t exceed $150K [and it applies to homes] that cost $675K or less,” she tells Daily Hive.

“You can look up homes in your pre-qualified price range through realtor.ca or you can ask your realtor to send you listings within your area of choice and budget range,” Mleczak says. “Realistically, you can still find one- and two-bedroom condos today within that price range in some areas of the Lower Mainland.”

Keep in regular contact with your realtor because new real estate listings come up daily.

Don’t use online mortgage calculators — speak to an expert

Rather than looking for mortgage tips on social media or using an online calculator, Mleczak recommends speaking to a mortgage expert who’s on top of the latest tips and tricks to help you succeed.

“Keep in mind that a lot of the online mortgage calculators will not take into consideration the stress test which will lower the mortgage amount you can qualify for,” she says.

Get your finances in order

A mortgage expert will examine your debt-to-income ratio, your net worth, and your credit history.

“I recommend keeping stable employment for at least two years prior to applying for a mortgage as it can strengthen your application significantly,” says Mleczak. “If you are self-employed, you will have ideally filed at least two years’ worth of tax returns.”

Your net worth is calculated by taking your total assets (e.g. cash and investments) and subtracting your liabilities (i.e. personal loans, credit cards, student loans, unpaid taxes, and mortgages). “Sadly, we won’t include designer handbags or shoes in this calculation,” says Mleczak.

Next comes your credit history — the importance of which Mleczak can’t emphasize enough.

“I don’t think we as teenagers were taught enough about the importance of maintaining a good credit score,” she says. “This is why it is important to start building a clean credit history as soon as you turn 19 in BC.”

Be prepared for closing costs

It’s not just the downpayment and the monthly mortgage payments you need to consider, but closing costs and renovations too.

“There are also various closing costs you may not be aware of such as mortgage default insurance premiums (if you are putting less than 20% down), home insurance premiums, moving costs, utility hook-up charges, title insurance, legal costs, and more.”

There could be other hidden costs too, like renovations.

“The general rule of thumb is that you should allow for a minimum of 1% of your purchase price for closing costs,” says Mleczak.

That’s why Prospera is offering a mortgage cash incentive of up to $3K for a limited time to assist with some of these costs.

Keep an open mind

Once you get a mortgage approval, Mleczak advises home seekers to “keep an open mind when searching for your first home.”

“I like to remind my members that your first home may not be your dream home. As you build equity and perhaps renovate, you may build enough equity room to purchase that dream home later down the road.”

All of Prospera’s mortgages are portable so you’ll have the flexibility to transfer that mortgage to a different property during your mortgage term.

“Be open to looking for a home that may require minor repairs/renovations and don’t be afraid to ask for help from family members,” says Mleczak, who often sees first-time buyers getting help from their parents."
2,"Someone asked me this week if young Canadians are simply “too addicted to debt.”

I will add that it was in the context of a discussion on the current state of our real estate market presently, you may have heard, in the midst of a “recalibration” following two years of absolutely mind-blowing activity that somehow carried us through a global pandemic.

The implication being that the Canadians now squeezed by gajillion dollar mortgages in the rising-rate-and-declining-value environment are essentially on par with that dude from high school who thinks it’s cool to spend the bulk of his monthly income on a leased Range Rover while living in a basement apartment complete with mattress on the floor.

It’s not the same.

People have been lamenting the mounting unaffordability of Toronto real estate for years and years and years, but it was really the pandemic market in which things descended into lunacy, with the House Price Index up by 62% at the peak from where it was just three years ago pre-pandemic.But now that we are rapidly coming down off of that February peak, the throngs of largely Millennial and Gen Z first-time buyers who somehow managed to get in by jumping in are now finding themselves the subject of scorn and ridicule.

Someone please make it make sense.

I would maybe understand it if we were limiting the discussion to the casual investors who driven by greed overleveraged themselves, but the keyboard critics don’t seem to make any distinction.

How many years have people been describing Toronto as a bubble waiting to burst? My friend’s parents thought it was a smart move to cash out at what they were absolutely certain was the peak in 2007 — that same home in midtown just traded last fall for three times what they sold for (and that’s following both the 2008 and 2017 downturns, thank you very much).

When a global pandemic didn’t actually burst the bubble but instead only served to accelerate it, buyers were quite literally watching the market outpace their capacity to save. Hence the FOMO — which may have been partially driven by a desire to catch the rock-bottom rates, but more so, I would argue, about not missing the moment and being priced out forever.

Do you know how many clients I have worked with that were waiting until finding a suitable home before starting a family? Who would have been thrilled with a condo if they could find one that was actually suitable for three human people including babies who sleep? Or wished that renting didn’t mean being at the mercy of a landlord that can sell your home out from under you pretty much at any moment?

These people I’m referring to weren’t casually day trading real estate, they were searching for a home, including all of the intangible, non-monetary benefits that comes alongside that security.

Those who purchased at what we now understand to be the peak of the market will almost universally acknowledge that they spent far more than they ever wanted to but found little alternative. Their budgets likely started out somewhere on the low end of what the bank preapproved but incrementally grew with each unsuccessful offer. Maybe they were fortunate and the Bank of Mom and Dad was able to pitch in. Or maybe they decided that cutting out Ubers and dinners out was worth it to make the numbers work. After all, let’s not forget that we have the stress test to keep us safe!

Sure, hindsight being 20/20 and all, it may be easy to Monday morning quarterback it, but the clear sense of delight detectable in the comments under pretty much any online article about this “correction” is enough to make me want to scream.

According to Oxford English Dictionary, the term schadenfreude refers to the “pleasure derived by someone from another person’s misfortune” And sure, there’s lots to unpack when looking at all that has transpired around us over the past two and a half years. But maligning a whole generation of young people who weren’t satisfied to be shut out of a fundamental human right ain’t it, friends. Please, oh please, redirect that scorn towards our politicians who created, sustained and tacitly approved of these appalling conditions in the first place."
3,"GTA rent prices in May saw the largest monthly hike in more than three years at 5.7 per cent as supply tightens and demand surges.

A new report by Bullpen Research & Consulting and TorontoRentals.com found the average monthly rent in the GTA increased by 16.5 per cent year-over-year, from $1,998 in May 2021 to $2,327 in May 2022. But rents in May are still slightly below pre-pandemic costs. In May 2019, the average rental was $2,365.

“Investor-owned condominiums led the way, experiencing significant annual growth of 25 per cent from May of last year,” said Ben Myers, president of Bullpen Research & Consulting, in a statement.

“High demand for downtown rental properties, coupled with less supply due to rate hikes and delayed occupancies of new projects as a result of labour stoppages and supply chain issues are all contributing factors to the rent inflation.”

The surge in demand also stems from immigration, students, and recent graduates moving out of their parents’ homes, the report said.

In addition, fewer people tend to move during uncertain economic times, and more would-be first-time homebuyers are deciding to stay on the sidelines and in rental housing, drying up supply, the report added.

Jordan Rasberry, co-founder and broker of Core Assets Real Estate, said he expects the rapid rise in rents to continue until September and October and then level out.

“This huge surplus of active tenants will have secured places and then (we) will return to a more normal ebb and flow in the rental market,” he said.

In May, Toronto had the highest average monthly rent for condo and apartments rentals at $2,438 a month, an annual increase of 19.8 per cent.

Burlington and Etobicoke followed closely, with average monthly rents of $2,233 and $2,263 per month respectively. From May 2021 to May 2022 Burlington saw an increase of 18.3 per cent and Etobicoke 17 per cent.

Next in line for average monthly rent for condo and apartment rentals were: Mississauga at $2,224, up 12.9 per cent year over year; Oshawa at $1,807, up 12.4 per cent annually; York at $2,083, up 12.2 per cent; Oakville at $2,299, up 11.2 per cent; North York at $2,102, up 10.2 per cent and East York at $1,898, up 8 per cent.

Vaughan was the only city with an annual decline in average rent for condo and apartment rentals, seeing rates decrease by 6.6 per cent to $2,072 per month.

In Toronto, Cabbagetown was the only market where rents are lower this year compared to last for condo and apartment rentals, a change the report says is due to a shift in the average unit size of rental listings. Last year’s average unit size was 742 square feet, dropping to 586 this year, the report said.

The change in the rental market in May is a marked shift from the pre-pandemic market and is more competitive now, said Rasberry.

In 2019, the rental market peaked in August and September and began to decline leading up to the pandemic. Once the pandemic began in March, rental prices continued to decline, he said.

“That pre-pandemic period between October 2019 and March 2020 was a much more relaxed rental market. Most properties were not receiving multiple offers and the average number of days on market was much higher than it currently is. Most good properties in the downtown core that have flexible showing schedules are currently leasing out in one to four days,” Rasberry said."
4,"Whether you're a purchaser or a renter, it's becoming next to impossible to afford a place to live in Toronto. And amid the worst inflation spike the country has witnessed in decades, your gas and grocery bills aren't the only expenses trending upward right now.

Greater Toronto Area (GTA) rents skyrocketed by 16.5 per cent year-over-year last month, leaping from $1,998 in May 2021 to $2,327 in just one year, according to the latest national rent report from Bullpen Research & Consulting and TorontoRentals.com.

It's a substantial increase in rent prices, made so much worse when you plug the last year of inflation into your math.

According to the Bank of Canada's inflation calculator, the current average rent of $2,327 is worth roughly $2,507 in 2021 dollars.

Once you've factored in inflation, that 16.5 per cent increase hits wallets more like an approximately 24.5 per cent jump.

On a month-over-month scale, rents increased by 5.7 per cent in May, representing the largest monthly spike in over three years, though still a few bucks below the May 2019 rental average of $2,365.

The highest increases in average monthly rent occurred in, you guessed it, the City of Toronto proper, where the typical rent surged by 19.8 per cent year over year in May to reach $2,438.

The Bay Street corridor was a scorching hot spot for rental prices, posting the highest averages in the GTA. Renting a typical home in the heart of the city will now cost you $2,764 per month, a 12 per cent increase over last year and a single percentage point above the highs seen in 2019.

Not too far behind was the Mississauga City Centre area, where condo and apartment rental prices saw an almost unbelievable 28 per cent jump year-over-year to $2,728 per month. Watch out Manhattan.

Experts point to rampant inflation as just one of many factors in rising prices, along with inflating interest rates, supply chain issues, and most importantly, an imbalance between the supply of housing and the fierce demand for units.

The report states that this supply drought is worsened by economic uncertainty, as ""fewer people tend to move during uncertain economic times, and more would-be first-time home buyers are deciding to stay on the sidelines and in rental housing, drying up supply."""
5,"The Los Angeles real estate market is showing signs of being affected by the rising levels of inflation and mortgage rates as the year progresses. 

New data from Core Logic shows that the real estate market sales in May of 2022 are possibly the worst in 34 years, dropping 16 percent from the heights of May of 2021, as reported by CBS. Sellers have also started cutting the listing prices because buyers are having difficulty with the increase in mortgage rates and the country’s rising inflation. This has made potential buyers much more cautious about jumping in on a sale. 

These price cuts, which are happening not just in Los Angeles, but all over the United States, are a warning sign that the real estate’s golden period may be coming to an end. Still, this doesn’t necessarily mean that home prices are dropping and even with the current conditions in the market, most home sales are still being purchased for more than the listing’s price. 

Core Logic has also reported that median monthly payments in Los Angeles have increased 40 percent from 2021 to 2022. Real estate experts blame this on the high prices of homes and mortgage rates for this occurrence according to CBS News.com. 

Yolanda Cortez, an L.A. area agent at Century 21 Realty Masters told the Los Angeles Times, “I have buyers who are now kind of at a standstill.” Cortez added that because of the interest rates rising, buyers who had other plans are being forced to consider areas like the Antelope or Victor valleys in the high desert which are 60 miles from the Los Angeles city center. 

All of this is causing a domino effect of fewer homes going into escrow, and a rising inventory of homes for sale which is causing sellers to have to make changes. The number of homes for sale that has reduced their listing prices has doubled in the last year. In fact, 16.2 percent of home listings in Los Angeles County have cut their price in the last four weeks. This is up from 7.5 in the same period last year.

Altos Research’s founder Michael Simonsen feels that even though there are buyers who are now priced out, he thinks that other buyers may have hit the pause button for different reasons. With inventory rising, those who can buy have decided not to which has caused a slowdown to become real. 

Simonsen said, as quoted by the Los Angeles Times, “Buyers know they can wait maybe until the summer and have more selection.”"
6,"ORANGE, Calif.—As the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, economists say it would significantly lower demand in the housing market and impact local home prices.

According to the semiannual economic forecast recently released by Chapman University, economists predict Orange County’s median home price would fall by 12 percent down from $1,012,000 in mid-2022 to $891,000 a year after.

Average home prices are heavily dependent upon mortgage rates and housing appreciation will continue to decline for all four quarters of next year, according to the report.

Raymond Sfeir, director of the A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research and economics professor at Chapman, said he expects the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to reach 6.5 percent by the end of this year and can only go higher in 2023.

“The price is going to be a little bit lower at the end of the year and the beginning of next year. That’s a plus for the buyer. But if they wait that long, they’re going to pay more in mortgage rate,” he told The Epoch Times.

Whether homebuyers should buy a home now or wait until the home prices come down after several months, Sfeir said, it really depends on how much in loans they plan to take out. With the current trend, he said that potential homebuyers who are paying with cash should wait until the end of this year as they will not be affected by the high mortgage rates.

In terms of the rental market, he said it is “pretty bad” because apartment owners are now increasing the rent at a very high rate and puts people at risk of becoming homeless. However, the labor market is very robust, he said.

“Many people are going to continue to have a job and those who don’t have one can find one easily these days because demand is so high for workers,” Sfeir said.

For jobs, the average growth in Orange County this year is forecasted to be 5.1 percent versus 5.5 percent in California. However, the decline in population may negatively affect local businesses and services, according to Jim Doti, president emeritus and economics professor at Chapman.

At a Chapman’s June 23 Economic Forecast Update in Orange, California, Doti pointed out that the county is experiencing a drop in population annually and is seeing negative growth in the total population.

The population decline, Doti said, is neither due to low birth nor high death rates but domestic migration. In a three-year period from 2018 to 2020, Orange County has lost 2.4 percent of its population.

“More people are moving out of the county … we have found that the major loss in population is as you would expect, given that migration. Migration is leading to the loss. It’s people in the prime working-age from 25 to 44,” Doti said."
7,"”Survey says” looks at various rankings and scorecards judging geographic locations while noting these grades are best seen as a mix of artful interpretation and data.

Buzz: The pandemic era’s quickly cooling housing boom turned many cities where home-price gains have been the biggest into the markets where it’s more likely a wannabe seller is cutting their asking price.

Source: My trusty spreadsheet’s analysis of a Zillow report on May’s home-selling conditions in the nation’s 50 largest metro areas — concentrating what’s behind reductions in listing prices. The market clearly is softening, to use a polite phrase, as a combination of high prices and soaring mortgage rates created too many unaffordable options for house hunters.

Top line
In Los Angeles and Orange counties, 10% of homes listed for sale in May had reductions in the asking price — but that ranked only the 33rd highest share of the 50 metros. In the Inland Empire, 13% of listing had price cuts — 12th highest. Nationwide, price cuts were found on 12% of all listings vs. 8% in February.

May’s highest? New Orleans and Salt Lake City at 16%, and Sacramento at 15%. Fewest? Virginia Beach, Boston and San Jose at 8%.

Details
Look at the 50 metros, sliced into thirds by a ranking of price cuts.

Asking price reductions were more likely to occur where home values had greater appreciation. The 16 metros with the most price cuts had home values up an average 24% in a year vs. 18% in the 16 metros where price cuts are rarest. Sellers have may have misread the durability of recent price gains.

L.A.-O.C. had the No. 22 gain, up 21% over 12 months. The Inland Empire was No. 15 at 26%. Nationwide? 24%.

Raleigh and Tampa had the largest appreciation of the 50 at 37%, then Orlando at 33%. Smallest increases? Washington at 10%, Baltimore at 11%, Milwaukee and Pittsburgh at 12%.

Owners are adjusting prices more frequently as fewer sales contracts are signed. So-called “pending sales” fell an average 21% the past year in metros where the most price cuts fell vs. down 19% where price cuts were least seen.

L.A.-O.C. pending sales were down 24% in the last 12 months, and that was 13th biggest drop. The Inland Empire was off 17%, the 15th smallest dip. Nationwide? Off 20%.

Biggest falls is dealmaking were in Salt Lake City, down 38%, Miami, down 33%, and Hartford, down 31%.  Just two markets had gains in pending sales — Birmingham, up 6%, and Memphis, up 5%.

Bottom line
Some sellers are feeling the house hunter’s financial pain — and discounting their listings to meet shrinking demand.

Zillow estimated what monthly payment a buyer might get in May in each of the 50 metros — principal, interest, taxes and insurance for the typical home, assuming a 30-year fixed-rate loan with a 20% downpayment at 5.23% vs. the 2.96% rate of a year earlier.

Again, discounts followed bad news. Metros with the most price cuts had average hikes in projected payments of 52% vs. 44% where discounted listings were harder to find.

L.A.-O.C.’s payment jump was 52% — and it was only the 19th largest hike! The Inland Empire was No. 14 at 56%. Nationwide? 47%.

Raleigh topped this ranking at 70%. Then came Tampa at 66%, and Las Vegas at 65%.

Even the nation’s “smallest” payment leaps were scary. Milwaukee was 34% pricier over 12 months, Pittsburgh was up 35%, and Hartford and Minneapolis rose by 37%."
8,"Home purchases by investors recently declined in the top 10 U.S. cities by market share — including Tampa. Even so, data shows investors still hold almost 25% of the market share, or the total sales made in the market.
Investor purchases of homes in the greater Tampa Bay region declined 13% since last summer, according to new data released by real estate brokerage Redfin.

Taylor Marr, chief deputy economist at Redfin, said this could be an indicator that the housing market is stabilizing.

“So the entire housing market is cooling down. It's reacting, sort of backing off the high levels of demand that we had throughout the pandemic,” Marr said.

Tampa is among the top 10 U.S. cities by market share that saw a dip in investor purchases during the first quarter.

Records on housing sales and purchases from 40 counties across the country were part of Redfin’s data analysis. Investors were defined as buyers with the keywords ""LLC,"" ""Inc.,"" ""Trust,"" ""Corp"" or ""Homes"" in its name, according to the report.

In Tampa, investors bought 4,214 homes between January and March. That’s down from a record number of 5,065 homes last summer but still above pre-pandemic levels.

Even so, investors have been able to hold onto a 25% market share, or the proportion of total value in a certain market. This means even while buying less homes, investors have maintained the same amount of value in Tampa’s housing market.


Marr said the pullback on investor purchases in the housing market can be explained by the jump in mortgage interest rates, impacting demand, and higher borrowing costs.

“As a result, buyers are just priced out of the market and we’re seeing demand pull back,” he said. “And investors are not immune.”

Marr said it could be good news for individual homebuyers if there’s less investor competition in Tampa’s housing market.

“They behave differently than your typical mom-and-pop landlord,” he said.

The prevalence of investors can add upward pressure to the housing and renting markets: driving up home prices, the cost of rent and the rate of evictions. It’s also common for first-time homebuyers to get outbid by cash-based offers in an investor-heavy market.

Lei Wedge, an associate professor at USF’s Muma College of Business, said that in the last year 25% of all homes sold in Tampa were paid for in cash. She said that’s a large jump when compared to another peak year in the housing market, in 2006, when 8% of Tampa homes were bought in cash.

Less investor competition may be good news for homebuyers. But Wedge said there are other factors that make it hard to be a buyer in Tampa’s housing market.

“Yeah, you have less investors. You have fewer people buying. But the problem is…it’s going to be a lot more expensive for your mortgage,” she said.

Wedge explained that it will be easier for individual buyers to find a home. But it may be harder for them to afford it.

This is especially true considering the influx of people to the greater Tampa Bay region who are willing to pay higher rent and mortgages. Wedge predicts the market will ultimately end up catering to this population.

“I think what will happen is — eventually — the city’s going to squeeze the lower-income people out of the city,” she said.

On Chelsea Street in East Tampa, Antoinette Hayes-Triplett and realtor Melisha Patel stand outside of a home that's expected to close with the Tampa Hillsborough Housing Initiative by the end of the month.
CEO Antoinette Hayes-Triplett said that’s why the Tampa Hillsborough Housing Initiative is working to create innovative housing solutions for the community.

As part of its strategic plan, which was funded $4.7 million by Hillsborough County, THHI launched a shared housing initiative.

“The market has changed the way that we have to do business,” Hayes-Triplett said. “And we’re trying to be as flexible as possible and as creative as possible to make sure that people have housing.”

The shared housing initiative plans to provide 50 three- and four-bedroom homes in the Tampa community at a subsidized rent for people emerging from homelessness.

Last year, THHI purchased and repurposed two homes. Next week, it plans to close on two more homes on Chelsea Street in East Tampa. This comes after point-in-time data published earlier this month show a 4% jump in homelessness in Hillsborough County.

Hayes-Triplett said the initiative would like to amp up efforts, but the biggest roadblock is closing on contracts amid inflated home prices and investor competition in the market.

“Right now, it takes us 60 days to close. By that time, we’ve lost out to investors that are paying: in cash, site unseen, no appraisal, no inspections,” she said. “That’s the market that we’re dealing with.”"
9,"The cost of buying a home in Tampa Bay continued to increase in May, with the median sales price for single-family homes hitting $413,108 according to the latest data from Florida Realtors. That’s a 28.4% increase from last May.

Prices were up in every market across the state. The metro region that encompasses Naples, Immokalee and Marco Island saw the steepest year over year increase at 30.8% and had the highest median sale price at $850,000.

That growth may not last for long, though.

“May was still the peak time,” said Lei Wedge, a professor of finance at University of South Florida’s Muma College of Business. “But that data does not represent the future.”

She said the price of pending homes has already started to cool off and will likely drop further thanks to rising mortgage rates.

Sales last month in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater market were down 7.5% percent from where they were the year before. Despite this, Tampa Bay led the state in single-family home sales this May, with 4,406 closed sales.

Trailing slightly behind was the Miami metro area (which includes Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach) with 4,151 closed sales on single-family homes. That’s down 15% from last year.

The number of active listings in Tampa Bay increased 34.7% from last May, but there was still only a one-month supply of inventory.

Wedge said the supply of homes is not likely to increase anytime soon and could possibly even decrease.

“There are lots of homeowners who wanted to sell their homes that may turn around now because they see prices dropping,” she said.

In order to compete in this tight market, many buyers are using cash offers to entice sellers. There were 1,390 cash sales last month, a 2.5% increase from May 2021."
10,"Purchasing a home is one of the most important investments there is. More than a place to live, homeownership is an asset with the potential to tremendously rise in value. Given the current state of the real estate market, housing affordability plays a determining role for buyers. As of June 17, 2022, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate sits at 6.25%. As a result of higher mortgage rates across the board, home prices have risen significantly. The typical home value in the United States increased over the last year by +20.9% to $334,141.

Although home prices have inflated all across the U.S., there are definitely certain areas that have a higher price tag than others. Location, size, age, and condition are all contributing factors to home value. Whether you choose to hold off your home-buying plans in hopes of the market cooling down or are looking to buy ASAP, it’s good to educate yourself on the market in different cities.

11,"A report from a website focused on home buying shows the price of housing in the U.S. is soaring — up 21 percent since the start of 2021.

House Method said in a press release on the report that it analyzed data on the 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and ranked them according to seven factors, including affordability, inventory, and population growth.

The House Method report found that the hot market has not, however, has not put a damper on buyers efforts given various market factors:

The housing market has exploded in recent years due to fluctuating mortgage rates, high demand accompanied by low inventory, as well as remote working opportunities allowing millions to rethink their home base. Americans have begun to rethink their priorities in a living space, many prioritizing space and comfort while others have flocked to bustling metropolises, leading to an exponential increase in home ownership.

House Method’s report highlighted these findings:

Homes remain on the market for an average of 15 days in the hottest markets, 10 days less than the national average
The most popular markets are also some of the least affordable
Home prices are projected to increase another 14.9 percent before 2023, even with steep mortgage rate increases
The top ten markets rarely remain on the market for more than 15 days, 40 percent less than the national average of 25 days
Many of the hottest housing markets are also some of the least affordable as demand increases and inventory decreases
Home equity has skyrocketed, allowing sellers to make huge profits

The report continued:

Our analyses found that Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida, tops the list as the hottest housing market this year. Homes are sitting on the market for the least amount of time before selling, selling for top dollar, and attracting new residents at a rapid rate. Low inventory combined with a quick sale rate contributed to its high score – and it’s important to note that many of the top spots ranked poorly for affordability.

As these hot housing markets continue to gain traction, we can assume that affordability will continue to dwindle. The other top 5 spots were rounded out by:

Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Arizona

Austin-Round Rock, Texas

Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Washington

San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California

The lowest metro area ratings went to Jackson, Mississippi; Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, Connecticut; Greensboro-High Point, North Carolina; McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina."
12,"The latest news out of the housing market isn’t good. Mortgage rates are soaring, and sales are dropping. 

The one puzzler is what's happening with prices.

The 30-year fixed-mortgage rate averaged 5.81% as of June 23, hitting a near-14-year-high, according to Freddie Mac. The rate rose from 5.78% last week, when it registered its biggest one-week surge since 1987. The rate was just 3.02% a year ago.

“Fixed mortgage rates have increased by more than two full percentage points since the beginning of the year,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement.

“However, in reality many potential homebuyers are still interested in purchasing a home, keeping the market competitive but leveling off the last two years of red-hot activity.”

Existing-home sales fell for the fourth straight month in May -- 3.4% from April and 8.6% from a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors.

""Home sales have essentially returned to the levels seen in 2019 -- prior to the pandemic -- after two years of gangbuster performance,"" NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. 

""Homes priced appropriately are selling quickly and inventory levels still need to rise substantially -- almost doubling -- to cool home price appreciation and provide more options for home buyers,"" Yun said.

Total housing inventory at the end of May rose 12.6% from April but slid 4.1% from a year ago.

Unsold inventory now totals a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.2 months in April and 2.5 months in May 2021.

""Further sales declines should be expected in the upcoming months given housing affordability challenges from the sharp rise in mortgage rates this year,"" Yun said.

However, prices aren't behaving intuitively, yet.

The median existing-home price hit $407,600 in May, up 14.8% from May 2021. This marks 123 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest streak in NAR records.

""Those of us who have been anticipating a deceleration in the growth rate of U.S. home prices will have to wait at least a month longer,"" Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&P DJI, said in a statement. “The strength of the [data] suggests very broad strength in the housing market, which we continue to observe.”

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home-price index posted a 20.6% annual gain in March, up from 20.0% in the previous month, according to the latest data."
13,"In response to April’s dismal report, I wrote that “new home sales are heavily revised after the first report. It is not unusual at all for big monthly moves like this to suddenly look much less severe when the number gets revised one month later. I would not be surprised in the slightest if that happened to this month’s cliff dive, when next month’s report comes out.”

That’s exactly what happened, as last month was revised higher by 38,000 to 629,000 units annualized. May came in at 696,000.
That’s still a big decline of -17% from their most recent peak last December, and -33% from their pandemic peak of August 2020 (blue in the graph below):

This is frequently – but not always! – consistent with an oncoming recession.
The particular value of new home sales is that, although it is a very noisy number, they frequently do peak and trough before either permits or starts, and did so again during this expansion. So for sales, this month was further confirmation that the declining trend is intact.
As to prices, in the graph above note that the median price of a new home (red) continued to rise. 
But the pace of the increase in prices has slowed considerably from +24% YoY last July to +15% in May:

In the past, as shown by the below comparison with the housing bubble and bust, prices have continued to rise sometimes for over a year after sales went into steep declines:



So prices may continue to rise for a number of months more before stalling or declining (and as I indicated the other day, I now expect significant declines).

Finally, sales and prices both lead inventory, as shown in the below graph including sales (blue) and inventory (gold) of new homes for sale:



Inventory is increasing even as sales decline. This of course is yet another reason to expect outright price declines soon. Just not as of yet."
14,"This morning's release of the May New Home Sales from the Census Bureau came in at 5696K, up 10.7% month-over-month from a revised 629K in April. The Investing.com forecast was for 588K. The median home price is now at $449K.

Here is the opening from the report:

New Home Sales


Sales of new single‐family houses in May 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 696,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 10.7 percent (±18.9 percent)* above the revised April rate of 629,000, but is 5.9 percent (±22.0 percent)* below the May 2021 estimate of 740,000.

Sales Price

The median sales price of new houses sold in May 2022 was $449,000. The average sales price was $511,400. [Full Report]

For a longer-term perspective, here is a snapshot of the data series, which is produced in conjunction with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The data since January 1963 is available in the St. Louis Fed's FRED repository here. We've included a six-month moving average to highlight the trend in this highly volatile series.

Over this time frame, we see the steady rise in new home sales following the 1990 recession and the acceleration in sales during the real estate bubble that peaked in 2005. Since 2011, we have seen a similar rise that has only recently retracted. We shall see if this retraction continues or is simply temporary.

The Population-Adjusted Reality

Now let's examine the data with a simple population adjustment. The Census Bureau's mid-month population estimates show a 77% increase in the US population since 1963. Here is a chart of new home sales as a percent of the population.

New single-family home sales are 17.8% above the 1963 start of this data series. The population-adjusted version is 33.5% below the first 1963 sales and at a level similar to the lows we saw during the Great Recession. Today's 30-year rate is 5.81%.

For another perspective, here is a chart of the median new home sale prices back to 1963, inflation-adjusted. The data source is also the Census Bureau and can be found on the press release and website above. For inflation adjustment, we use the CPI-U, which is the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. We've included a 6-month moving average for this extremely volatile metric to give us a clearer sense of the trend."
15,"If you’ve been house hunting in the past couple of years, it’s probably felt as though there’s a giant “no vacancy” sign hanging in the buyer’s market. The homes that do go up for sale have been flying off the market in record time (often over their list prices), and you keep hearing the same buzz phrase: “There’s an inventory shortage!”

That shortage? It’s acute. According to a report from Realtor.com, America is short by more than 5 million homes based on the population. So how did we get to the point where it’s so hard to even find a home to buy, and is there any relief in sight? Ahead, real estate experts break it down.

Why is there such an extreme inventory shortage?
You can trace this housing inventory shortage back to the last recession. When the housing bubble burst in 2008, a lot of the smaller home builders went out of business, slowing the production of new homes across the country, says Isaiah Henry, the CEO of Seabreeze Management Company, a group that manages commercial and residential properties in California and Nevada.

While building slowly started to pick back up, global supply chain issues in the past couple of years blunted the progress. Price increases for building supplies like lumber and oriented strand board (OSB), a widely used structural wood paneling, are contributing to the extreme bottleneck, according to the National Association of Home Builders.

Traditionally, home builders in this country have averaged about a million homes per year—or at least they should have been, in order to keep up with soon-to-be-needed demand, says Fort Walton Beach, Florida real estate agent Andrew Iremonger with eXp Realty. In the last decade, he says, builders haven’t come close to hitting that million home per year mark except in 2021.

“Enter Millennials,” Iremonger says. “They’re the second-largest buying demographic in history, just a tiny smidge behind the baby boomers.” The average first-time home buyer is 34 years and the average millennial is now turning 35, and as they continue to pour into the marketplace, more homes are needed, he points out.

On top of all this, companies like Opendoor, We Buy Ugly Houses, as well as home investors who do fixups and renovations have taken down a lot of the available housing inventory, says David Auerbach, managing Director of Armada ETF Advisors, who has more than two decades of experience in the real estate investment trusts industry. As for the new homes that are coming onto the market, many are outside of most homebuyers’ price ranges, Auerbach says.

How did the pandemic contribute to the inventory shortage?
Record-low interest rates during the pandemic undoubtedly brought out buyers who were excited to borrow money for cheap. Eager buyers, though, weren’t met with many for-sale homes, and sellers were in some cases gun shy.

“During the pandemic, a lot of people stopped selling their houses,” says DJ Olhausen, a San Diego, California realtor with Realty ONE Group Pacific. “This was in large part due to uncertainty of the future mixed with the general public’s wish to keep strangers out of their homes [for showings].”

In recent years, older generations and “empty nesters” have been staying in their homes much longer, which means they are not downsizing as they have in the past, says Jamie Erfle, a Philadelphia area realtor with Compass and team lead with Modern Luxe.

“During the Covid shutdown, many young adult children moved back home with their parents so that extra space was suddenly needed again,” she says.

The pandemic also put pressure on the rental market in new ways.

With a good deal of the workforce working from home for the past two years, the corporate world moved into residential neighborhoods, with spare bedrooms converting into offices and dining rooms becoming workspaces, says Baron Christopher Hanson, a consultant and realtor with Coldwell Banker Realty in Jupiter and Stuart, Florida.

“Extra space that might have been rented out all of a sudden went away in order to absorb hundreds of millions of WFH jobs,” he says.

Will interest rates free up inventory?
It remains to be seen how the rising interest rates will affect housing inventory.

One the one hand, the rising rates will likely dissuade homeowners from selling because they will want to keep their low monthly payments locked in, Olhausen says. “Who wants to upgrade to a new home when your mortgage rate will be 3 points higher than your current mortgage?” he says.

On the other hand, more investors will be pushed out of potentially buying into the housing market, Auerbach says.

Plus, the rising rates could sideline some buyers, meaning less competition for those who are serious about finding a home and refinancing to a lower rate down the line.

“The good news: the rising 2022 interest rates and the urgency to ‘lock in’ rates is cooling, meaning more inventory and some breathing room for buyers,” says Carolyn Gagnon, a licensed real estate salesperson with Compass NYC."
16,"We could see a new kind of buyer’s market in 2023.
There are signs that the real estate market is cooling.
Home sales have declined, while price reductions have increased.
Next year, buyers will likely have more negotiating leverage.
For the past two years or so, we’ve heard countless stories about the strong seller’s market conditions in cities across the U.S. Record-low inventory levels and surging demand forced buyers to compete fiercely with one another and led to unprecedented price growth nationwide.

But now, it seems that change is in the air. A growing number of real estate industry reports have shown that the red-hot housing market might finally be cooling down.

In fact, some cities across the U.S. might see a new kind of buyer’s market in 2023. Inventory levels will likely remain below historical norms for the foreseeable future. But rising prices and higher rates should reduce the number of buyers, shifting the dynamic between supply and demand.

Yes, the U.S. Real Estate Market Is Cooling
As of early summer 2022, we’re seeing a number of significant changes within the U.S. real estate market. Inventory has risen and homes are taking longer to sell in many cities.

Here are five ongoing trends that could affect home buyers well into 2023:

Slower price growth. A growing number of analysts have predicted slower home-price growth through the rest of this year and in 2023. Prices could even drop in some of the nation’s hottest real estate markets. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, recently said that his firm expects U.S. home prices to drop in markets that are the most “juiced” or overvalued.
Fewer home sales. Realtor.com recently reported that U.S. home sales declined in May, for the fourth month in a row. Lawrence Yun, the company’s chief economist, wrote: “Further sales declines should be expected in the upcoming months given housing affordability challenges from the sharp rise in mortgage rates this year…”
More priced reductions. Sellers seem to sense that the market is cooling. Price cuts by sellers were seen in 10.5% of homes in May of 2022, up from 6.2% in May of 2021. LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel recently stated: “Fewer people are getting mortgages, homes are sitting on the market for longer and some sellers are cutting prices.”
More inventory. Of all the factors that could create buyer’s real estate market conditions in 2023, inventory tops the list. For the past two years, buyers have been frustrated by record-low inventory levels. But now, more and more homes are coming onto the market. A June 2022 Realtor.com report said: “New data suggests the U.S. housing market hit a turning point in its supply struggle in May, as active inventory recorded the first year-over-year increase since June 2019.”
Higher mortgage rates. At the start of this year, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage loan was 3.22% (source: Freddie Mac’s weekly survey). Last week that average was up to 5.81%, an increase of more than two full percentage points. Higher rates and home prices could further reduce buyer demand going forward.
All of these trends could create a more balanced and “buyer-friendly” housing market during the second half of 2022 and into 2023. We probably won’t see anything resembling a traditional buyer’s market for quite some time. Instead, next year could bring real estate market conditions unlike anything we’ve seen in the past.

Higher Costs Have Reduced Demand
Housing costs have increased substantially over the past couple of years, partly driven by a pandemic-fueled surge in home buying activity.

The chart below shows the U.S. median home value going back ten years, as measured by the real estate data company Zillow. Note the steep acceleration in price growth that started in 2021. As a result of that trend, more and more would-be buyers have been priced out of the housing market.

The next chart shows the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage loan over the past year. It’s based on the weekly mortgage industry survey conducted by Freddie Mac. Notice how much higher rates are now (right side of chart) compared to early January of 2022.

The bottom line is that home-buying costs have surged over the past couple of years. This has slowly but surely reduced the number of buyers who can afford to make a purchase. Going forward, this reduction in demand could shift the housing market in a way that begins to favor buyers for a change.

A New Kind of Buyer’s Market in 2023?
Many economists have predicted a more balanced real estate market in the months ahead. In June, for example, researchers from Freddie Mac issued the following statement:

“Higher mortgage rates will lead to moderation from the blistering pace of housing activity that we have experienced coming out of the pandemic, ultimately resulting in a more balanced housing market.”

In 2023, we could see a new kind of buyer’s real estate market in many U.S. cities. Historically speaking, a “buyer’s market” occurs when supply exceeds demand. It’s when the number of houses for sale is greater than the number of buyers looking to purchase them.

That’s unlikely to happen in 2023. It will be quite some time before the current supply shortage turns into a surplus. Even so, we could see a new kind of situation where buyers have increasingly more negotiating leverage despite tight inventory conditions.

Sure, homes are still in short supply in markets across the country. But there are other factors to consider as well, such as the record-breaking rise in home prices over the past two years. Add in higher mortgage rates, inflation, and other cost-of-living increases, and you have all the ingredients for a housing cooldown.

So perhaps we need a new definition of a buyer’s real estate market. Maybe we need to take the supply factor out of it, and define it solely in terms of negotiating leverage. This kind of market would occur when buyers start to have more negotiating power than sellers, due to a variety of factors.

And that’s something we could see in 2023."
17,"10 Housing Markets With the Most Sellers Dropping Prices
What was previously a mere cooling of the housing market may be settling into a deeper freeze.

In many markets, more than 40% of home sellers dropped their prices during the month of May, according to real estate brokerage Redfin.

The trend started in earnest during April, when nearly 20% of home sellers began lowering their asking price. But now, it appears to be accelerating.

According to Redfin:

“Price drops are especially common in mid-sized metros in the West — particularly in Utah –many of which had outsized price growth during the pandemic because they were hotspots for people moving in from other parts of the country.”

Following are the cities with the largest share of homes for sale with a price drop during May 2022.

18,"Changes in demand caused by the pandemic were, of course, a big part of the house price boom but two years of falling mortgage rates was the main reason house prices skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021. Rates fell from 4.9% in November 2018 to 2.7% in January 2021, the lowest rate ever on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
Is there a sector of the economy that is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than buying houses? When you borrow 95% of the price of the largest purchase of your life for 30 years, interest rates have a huge impact on how much you can pay for a house and, therefore, on house prices in general.
In January 2021, you could borrow 32% more money to buy a house than you could in November 2018 with the exact same monthly principal and interest mortgage payment. House buyers, both investors and live-in buyers, could borrow a lot more money with the same payment, so naturally, over time, they bid up house prices.
With historically low mortgage rates and houses appreciating $100,000 in one year in some cities, investors were, naturally, buying a lot more investment houses.
Then, after house prices had been skyrocketing for a while, both investors and live-in home buyers expected prices to continue skyrocketing so they continued to bid up house prices long after mortgage rates stopped falling.
Isn’t it ironic that the Fed’s mandate is “stable prices” but the Fed is the biggest destabilizer of house prices?
The Fed says housing costs are by far the largest component of consumer spending but the Fed doesn't include house prices in its inflation calculation, it only includes rents! When they calculate inflation, the Fed doesn’t consider the price inflation of the most expensive thing you'll ever buy in your life, your house.
This explains why the Fed frequently destabilizes house prices—house prices are not part of the Fed's ""stable prices"" mandate. When the main way you steer the economy is through interest rates, you naturally destabilize the part of the economy that is most sensitive to interest rate changes, the market for new and resale houses.
This might be a good time for incumbent politicians to promote stable, sustainable house price inflation instead of our current hodge-podge of policies that have somehow evolved into a system that promotes larger and larger housing booms.
The Fed isn’t going to stop using interest rates to speed up and slow down the economy when needed so we need to find ways to make house prices less hyper-sensitive to changes in Fed interest rates.
Current home owners might support remodeling our current policies to reduce periods of high house price inflation (fewer, smaller booms), if we also eliminate periods of house price deflation (no busts).
Can we update the Fed's mandate to be, “stable prices, including house prices” and let the Fed figure out how to reach the goal?
In the past, however, the Fed has not been interested, at all, in stabilizing house prices. It’s not in their DNA. To the Fed, house price instability is just unavoidable collateral damage in their fight for stable consumer prices and maximum employment.
A better solution might be to create a ""Fed"" for house prices since the Fed doesn't cover house prices. That is, create a ""Central Housing Bank"" with one goal, “permanently sustainable house price increases and no decreases” to help stabilize the largest part of American family wealth.
Perhaps like the Fed, our new Central Housing Bank should have a dual mandate with the second goal being to “maximize free-and-clear home ownership for live-in owners.” A hundred years ago, the percentage of U.S. home owners that owned their houses free-and-clear was phenomenally higher than today. It can be increased.
If house prices stop increasing as seems likely given current high prices and future demographic trends, the top source of family housing wealth for younger generations will come from paying off their mortgages, not from house price appreciation.
A goal to maximize free-and-clear home ownership for live-in owners (owner-occupants) would also tend to lead to policies that make house prices less sensitive to Fed interest rate changes. Then when the Fed pumps up the economy when the real estate market is already strong, it wouldn't send the real estate market into orbit, and when the Fed slows down the economy, it wouldn't slam the brakes on such a hyper-sensitive housing market.
Whether we change the Fed mandate or create a new Central Housing Bank, or neither–one way or another, top goals of U.S. government policy should be to have sustainable house price increases and no price decreases, and to maximize free-and-clear home ownership. We have a lot of economic knobs we can turn to achieve these goals if we want to.
We can at least stop our current government policies that unnecessarily distort and destabilize house prices. Today, for example, we give huge tax breaks to investors of single-family houses that live-in owners don’t get. Those investor tax breaks, naturally, destabilize house prices because they pay investors to buy more houses than they would otherwise during booms, making our real estate booms bigger, and then our real estate busts bigger, than they would be otherwise.
More stable, sustainable house price increases would greatly stabilize the U.S. economy and household wealth.
They would also stabilize U.S. politics because when—through no fault of their own—family house prices and family wealth falls, a lot of people get mad at the world and their politicians, and want change.
First let’s choose the destination, then let’s talk about how to get there."
19,"New home sales increased by less than expected across the U.S. last month, after a slump in April, according to data released today by the Census Bureau.

Sales of new single-family houses in May were 10.7 percentage points above the revised total of 629,000 in April, when new home sales plunged 16.6 percent month-on-month to their lowest level since April 2020, as costs continued rising for both home builders and potential buyers.

May's new home sales were still 5.9 percent below the May 2021 estimate of 740,000.

First-time buyers are being squeezed out of the market, as a combination of soaring mortgage rates, the limited inventory available, soaring inflation and record-high home prices—34 percent higher now than two years ago—is hitting them hard.

Buying a house is simply not affordable for many people at the moment.

Mortgage rates are at their highest levels since 2008, after the average 30-year rate rose from 3.1 percent to 6.28 percent on June 14.

The Federal Reserve's increases in its key interest rate amid surging consumer prices is making borrowing significantly more expensive, adding pressure on housing costs and further slowing spending.

House prices are also putting many homes out of reach for buyers. The median sales price of new houses sold in May 2022 was $449,000. The average sales price in the same month was $511,400.

The global cost of living crisis is also profoundly affecting consumers' wallets, further hindering their chances of buying new homes.

Will There Be a Housing-Market Crash?
As demand fizzles, the housing market may slow significantly, leading some analysts and observers to talk about a bursting of the bubble, or even a market crash.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, this week told a bipartisan housing policy summit in Washington, D.C.that he expects a nationwide correction from ""coast to coast.""

In recent years, home buyers have flocked to the market, lured by attractive home-loan rates during the pandemic. Prices soared as buyers competed for a limited number of homes on sale as the market and new-home construction took time to recover from the global financial crisis.

Home builders, managing the rising costs of construction and a continuous decline in buyers' demand, are getting less confident as to whether it's worth building new homes —a factor that could contribute to a further lack of supply in the market.

A crash would be the worst scenario that could come out of the current situation, and many economists doubt that the housing market is set for a similar crash to the infamous one of 2008. The sector is much more secure now that it was 14 years ago, when applicants were still able to get ""no-doc loans"" and they were far more likely to default.

Nicole Bachaud, an economist at Zillow, told Forbes that, ""lending standards have gotten tighter and credit scores for new mortgages are much higher on average now than they were in the early 2000s.""

""What's much more likely is a gradual slowdown in the pace of price appreciation where home prices continue growing, just not as fast as they are now,"" Bachaud added.

Homeowners and lenders are also in a much stronger situation now than they were then, with higher house prices and better levels of home equity. Both are unlikely to panic over the current slowdown.

Another potential outcome would be that the housing market ""corrects"" itself more gently, adapting to waning demand with the cooling down of home prices. That would allow first-time buyers —the largest group of people purchasing homes, now mostly Millennials— to start buying homes again.

Doug Duncan, the chief economist of Fannie Mae, said in a statement: ""Mortgage rates have ratcheted up dramatically over the past few months, and historically such large movements have ended with a housing slowdown.""

Jacob Channel, a senior economist at Lending Tree, told the New York Post that surging interest rates have already led to a red-hot housing market from the past couple of years begin to cool down.

""This current 'correction' is neither unexpected nor necessarily a bad thing — especially as it will give some buyers a bit more breathing room when they're housing hunting,"" Channel said."
20,"The US Census Bureau reported that new residential housing units were started at an annual rate of 1.549 million in May, a whopping 14.4% decline from April and 3.5% below the rate of starts in May 2021. The sudden cooling off was attributed to both rapid price appreciation and a sharp spike in mortgage rates moving affordability beyond the reach of many buyers.

Single family home prices rose by nearly 20% in 2021 driven by strong demand and exacerbated by critical shortages of materials and labor in the wake of the pandemic. But the housing crunch is not merely an artifact of the Covid supply chain disruption or the improvement in consumer debt profile and savings rates. The shortage of US housing has been building for nearly four decades and the market is still suffering a major hangover from the 2006 financial collapse.

The fact is that American housing construction has simply not kept pace with population growth since the 1980s. The April housing starts of 1.8 million units at an annual rate only just got us back to the 1998 level of new home construction and lags well behind the 2.5 million annual rate of the early 1970s. Meanwhile, the US population has grown by over 50% during that same period. And even though the Fed's ongoing rate hikes are dampening demand for now, the long-term imbalance will take many more years to abate.

While many remember the early 2000s as a period of excess in the residential real estate market, the fact is that construction of new dwelling units was just beginning to ramp up to meet population growth before the bottom fell out. It was not overbuilding per se but a confluence of factors relating to how the building expansion was financed that led to the catastrophic collapse that nearly took down the entire US economy. Persistent changes resulting from the crash have continued to hinder a full recovery in new construction ever since.

The factors leading to the 2006 crash are legion, including misguided government policy, the rise of nonbank lending, securitization of mortgage loans including subprime loans with lax underwriting, regulatory gaps, as well as greed and deceit by mortgage originators. It is estimated that $14 trillion in American wealth was destroyed, and that the average family suffered a 39% decline in net worth. Several reforms to mortgage lending and securitization were adopted in the aftermath of the carnage that made it more difficult to qualify for a home loan but also pushed some potential buyers out of the market.

Perhaps the most significant factor in the underbuilding of residential units is the carnage suffered by homebuilders during the crash. Prior to the Great Recession, the direct and indirect impact of residential construction and sales accounted for 15%-20% of US GDP. As the result of the ensuing crash into 2007-2009, over half of all residential builders left the industry due to financial stress or bankruptcy. Nearly one quarter of all US mortgages went underwater, leading millions of homeowners to mail in their keys to the bank. Millions of skilled construction workers left their trade behind to seek other employment, creating a skills deficit that has yet to be supplanted. Many builders today attest that the pandemic merely accentuated an already acute shortage of skilled labor.

Complicating the general underbuilding of dwellings is the mix of new construction. New supply of entry-level homes is particularly constrained. The share of new single-family units under 1,400 square feet comprises only about 10% of all homes compared with about a third of all homes in the 1970s, leaving many first-time buyers shut out of the market.

Local zoning laws in many communities favor individual homes and severely limit permitting of multi-family units, even where local market demand prefers them over stand-alone houses. Meanwhile, the regulatory burden on contractors has increased exponentially over the past generation and according to the National Association of Homebuilders accounts for 25% of the cost of the average home. This makes construction of entry-level housing essentially unprofitable.

The magnitude of the construction shortfall can be seen in the accompanying chart which shows the ratio of new housing starts to the level of population going back to the early 1970s. The graph shows the general downtrend in homes started per 1,000 population and highlights how construction has yet to fully recover from the 2006 crash.

A report from the National Association of Realtors in 2021 notes that on average, new dwelling units per year since 2001 have averaged around 1.25 million compared with 1.5 million from 1968 through 2000, creating an estimated deficit of 5.5 to 6.8 million homes. The report states that ""the scale of underbuilding and the existing demand-supply gap is enormous... and will require a major national commitment to build more housing of all types.""

The current cooling of demand may provide some relief to allow stressed supply chains to normalize and to train more skilled workers. But the broader issue is complex, involving governments at every level to rethink lending, zoning, and regulatory policy to allow the market to respond appropriately."
21,"Brian Milner is a former senior economics writer and global markets columnist for The Globe and Mail.
Rising borrowing costs, dimming economic prospects and stricter lending rules are taking some of the air out of housing bubbles in Canada, the United States and other markets in which strong demand, tight supply and speculative fever have driven prices to record levels and deepened an already serious affordability crisis.
The evidence that overheated markets are cooling is mounting. Canadian home resales slid 8.6 per cent in May from the previous month, and much more than that in such hot markets as Vancouver. Prices fell for a second consecutive month, after shooting higher through most of the COVID-19 pandemic, and some economists forecast a decline of up to 20 per cent this year as higher mortgage rates hit home.
Restoring a modicum of sanity to residential markets won’t do much for people seeking accommodation they can afford. But at least it will prevent the crisis from getting even worse, right? Well, not really.
Institutional investors, which have squeezed residential markets in many parts of the world, can be expected to pick up a purchasing pace that has turned them into the world’s biggest private landlords and transformed rental housing into a go-to global asset class.
“Institutional ownership threatens to accelerate the trends unleashed by the financialization of housing,” says a report commissioned by the Greens group in the European Parliament to buttress their case for a regional response to the crisis. “Deeper financial markets have not substantively increased either aggregate home ownership or housing supply, but instead have inflated house prices and pulled down rental yields.”
In Canada, the big institutional money has largely stuck with apartment buildings in major cities. But across the U.S., Britain and elsewhere in Europe, private equity firms, Wall Street investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, major pension funds (including the investment arm of the Canada Pension Plan), and their real estate partners and affiliates have been loading up on single-family homes.
The institutional crowd used to steer clear of this fragmented market that typically attracted small-scale mom-and-pop investors. But automated digital platforms have made it easier and cheaper to track, price, acquire and manage large swaths of homes in multiple communities. As they snap up properties, these bulk-buying acquisitors have helped drive up sales prices and rental costs, skewed development and, in some cases, exacerbated housing insecurity.
Defending a federal budget measure that calls for a two-year ban on home purchases by foreigners, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that houses “aren’t supposed to be assets for wealthy investors. They are supposed to be homes where families can raise their kids and create neighbourhoods and communities.”
It’s a fine sentiment. But the fact is that investors will keep knocking on Canadian doors. Foreign capital can easily team up with Canadian partners, and domestic investors routinely outbid house-hunting families. The attraction? The prospect of steady returns, long-term price appreciation and inflation protection – rent hikes far outstrip cost of living increases – at a time when rising volatility, soaring public debt and heightened geopolitical risk are clouding the outlook for stocks, bonds and other investments.
The financial heavyweights’ move into housing has been aided and abetted by governments through financial deregulation, tax breaks, subsidies for home owners, historically low borrowing costs and relief for renters, which translates into stable income for investors.
Years of loose monetary policy “contributed to making government bonds less and less attractive and housing finance more and more accessible, shifting investments into the real estate markets and creating house price bubbles, which increased housing unaffordability,” says Sebastian Kohl, a sociology professor at Berlin’s Free University and co-author of the European report, titled My Home is an Asset Class.
“On one hand, we say housing is a human right. But we see more and more resources allocated to supporting home ownership and private rental,” says Yushu Zhu, an assistant professor of urban studies and public policy at Simon Fraser University, who has researched housing inequality and the impact of turning the sector into “an investment opportunity.”
The crisis has triggered a growing public backlash to the power of the investors, as angry residents demand government action ranging from rent controls and stiffer sanctions to more drastic intervention.
In Berlin, institutional investors have gobbled up €40-billion (about $54.8-billion) worth of rental homes, double the combined value of what they own in London and Amsterdam, their next largest European markets. A majority of Berliners voted in a referendum last September to expropriate holdings of landlords with 3,000 or more apartments. A commission is currently investigating whether such a law would be constitutional.
People are fighting the investment tide in other markets, too, with varying degrees of success. In the Netherlands, the government has given municipal authorities the right to block companies from buying homes in lower-income districts and turning them into rentals. This comes after more than one-third of the properties sold in the country’s four largest cities in 2020 ended up in the hands of investors.
In the U.S., some communities have adopted rules to make corporate or investor purchases of single-family houses less attractive. A homeowners’ association in Charlotte, N.C., passed an ordinance in 2019 forcing buyers to wait two years before renting out their houses. Others have imposed similar impediments, which have occasionally slowed but not halted the investor-led shopping spree.
The largest and most experienced institutional player in the residential game is Blackstone Group, a global investing powerhouse with US$550-billion worth of property holdings running the gamut from office buildings, hotels, housing and retail complexes to industrial space, warehouses, data centres and research facilities.
Blackstone last month opened its first real estate office in Toronto to expand its already substantial presence in this country, where it holds $14-billion worth of property, mainly in the logistics sector, but also commercial and residential buildings in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.
The asset manager has spent billions acquiring housing in the U.S. and other markets, from Britain to China. Responding to criticism of its aggressive expansion, Blackstone points out that its funds own less than 1 per cent of rental housing in the U.S. and other markets where it operates. In a company statement, it said, “Given our ownership levels, we have virtually no ability to impact market rent trends. Rents are going up because there is significantly less supply of housing across the globe than demand for it.”
It’s true that Blackstone, Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Tricon Residential Inc. and the rest of the institutional buyers club combined account for no more than about 2 per cent of rental stock in any country. But that amounts to about 300,000 single-family houses in the U.S. alone, largely concentrated in certain districts of fast-growing cities and surrounding suburbs, many of them in the lightly regulated sunbelt states.
Institutional investors’ “domination of some local housing markets gives them the power to increase rents and dictate lease terms,” Suzanne Lanyi Charles, an associate professor of urban planning at Cornell University, wrote last month in The Hill, a Washington political website. She noted that “where their rentals are highly concentrated, mega-landlords have outsized power over the lives of residents. They can undermine renters’ access to those neighbourhoods as well as housing affordability and stability.”
The biggest American operator, Invitation Homes Inc., a publicly traded company worth about US$23-billion created by Blackstone, jacked up rents last year by 18 per cent for new leases, 8 per cent for renewals and almost 30 per cent in such booming U.S. markets as Las Vegas, she said.
Blackstone began crafting its single-family investment strategy in the U.S. a decade ago, when the market was still reeling from the 2008 financial meltdown and ensuing Great Recession. In the immediate aftermath of the housing collapse, Blackstone and other specialists in distressed assets loaded up on cheap foreclosed properties and later flipped them for quick profits.
But Blackstone and a handful of other players subsequently adopted a model in which large-scale holdings would be converted to rentals, producing a steady stream of income. Persistent housing shortages – nearly 30 U.S. states report deficits – ensured that demand would support higher rents even in a flagging economy.
The single-family rental game has since grown so profitable that developers want to play, too. Imagine a house-seeking family trying to compete with the likes of Core Development Group, a Toronto-based condo builder that unveiled plans last year to spend as much as $1-billion acquiring detached homes in various mid-sized cities.
In the U.S., home builder Lennar Corp. teamed up last year with the real estate subsidiary of German insurer Allianz and other institutional investors in a venture to buy more than US$4-billion worth of new houses and hang “for lease” signs on them. Another developer put its entire 124-house subdivision in a Houston suburb on the rental market and then sold it all last year to Fundrise, an online property investment platform that manages in excess of US$1-billion for more than 260,000 small investors.
None of these investments will do anything to address the acute lack of affordable housing. And neither will some of the enacted or proposed restrictions aimed at reining in the money crowd, including foreign ownership bans, steeper property taxes, rent caps, limits on evictions or even full disclosure of who owns what.
Interventions in the marketplace need to do more than improve conditions for home buyers and renters. They have to persuade the major financial players that it’s in their interests to earmark a chunk of their investors’ capital for the construction of more affordable housing – as a few funds are doing, profitably.
“The idea is not to keep institutional investors and their huge savings glut from entering the housing sector, but to regulate it properly,” Prof. Kohl of Free University says.
At the same time, policy makers dealing not only with the current crisis but challenges posed by reurbanization and the effects of climate change ought to consider dusting off some of the successful instruments developed in the aftermath of two world wars. These created “a veritable housing production machine under state orchestration that overcame the pent-up demand and … housing shortages within about two decades,” Prof. Kohl says.
One way to get that machine in gear would be for governments to put non-profit housing providers on a stronger competitive footing with private developers. It would also be “a more strategic, long-term way to deter this financialization,” Ms. Zhu of Simon Fraser argues.
In Europe, non-profit housing accounts for as much as 20 per cent of the supply in certain markets, and in some cases even more. In Vienna, a social-housing pioneer, a majority of renters live in municipally owned residences or subsidized non-profit co-operatives.
In Canada, social housing accounts for just 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the entire rental market, Ms. Zhu says. “Social housing providers are totally siloed. They cannot compete with the private market developers and they receive only very limited support from government.”
That situation isn’t going to change any time soon, at least not as long as housing remains too lucrative an asset for institutional investors to ignore."
22,"The Canadian real estate industry’s growth in the past few decades has seen it become a vital part of the Canadian economy. Year after year, the housing market was predicted to crash due to unbelievably high prices, yet prices kept rising throughout all major markets in the country.

The historically low interest rates combined with the stimulus being pumped into the economy by the Federal government amid the pandemic led to another unlikely boom in the housing sector.

However, rising inflation rates led to the need for the Bank of Canada (BoC) to introduce several interest rate hikes and control the red-hot inflation. As things stand at writing, it appears that the Canadian real estate boom might finally be ending.

What is happening?
Higher mortgage rates have considerably reduced the purchasing power of Canadians. Lower activity in the housing market has led to the housing market demand cooling down significantly in recent months. Desjardin, one of Canada’s largest financial institutions, anticipates that rising mortgage rates will cause the demand to decline further in the next few months.

Housing prices are still substantially higher than they were a year ago. However, the month-over-month increases in home prices across major Canadian housing markets have started to weaken.

Economists predict that the five-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rates will likely reach double the rates amid the pandemic. Increasing the cost of borrowing two-fold is bound to put a dent in housing market activity.

Desjardin has warned that as difficult as it might be to believe, the residential real estate industry boom will not only end, but it will make way for a substantial decline.

Housing prices will likely fall further
Lower demand in the housing market and rising borrowing costs combine with the inflationary environment to create the perfect conditions for a housing market decline. Fewer offers on properties will force owners to become more flexible and give prospective buyers more negotiating power.

It is possible for the housing market to do more than merely cool down in the coming months. Experts believe that home prices can fall to more reasonable levels that reflect the real value of homes next year.

Is real estate investing a wise decision right now?
If you want to buy a home as an investment property, you might want to consider the risk of home prices falling further in the coming months. There is no way to determine if and when prices will start rising again once they bottom out. Tying down a significant amount of your investment capital might not be the wisest move.

However, it is possible for you to gain exposure to the real estate industry through a more liquid asset class: real estate investment trusts (REITs).

REITs like Choice Properties REIT (TSX:CHP.UN) could offer you a more flexible and low-cost method to invest in the Canadian real estate industry. Choice Properties is one of Canada’s largest residential REITs that owns and manages a portfolio of residential units built on top of grocery chains in urban centres throughout the country.

The company owns, manages, and develops retail and commercial properties in Canada. Most of its locations are rented out by supermarkets that generate significant revenues for the company. Rising interest rates might deter many people who want to buy houses.

The demand for rental properties could rise in the coming months, allowing Choice Properties REIT to generate more cash flows through its residential units."
23,"Canada’s new homes market is showing strength, based on the latest data from May, with multi-family development leading the way.

Home starts data from last month outpaced analysts’ expectations with an annualized figure of 287,000 units, exceeding forecasts of a slight slowdown to 255,000 units, a recent report from CIBC Economics stated.

May’s rise in starts was driven by multi-family builds, rising by 13 per cent from the previous month. All told, multi-family starts accounted in May for about 201,000 starts per annualized rate, as noted in a separate report from TD Economics.

By comparison, single-family detached starts made up about 63,000 starts on an annualized basis, gaining four per cent in May on a month-over-month basis.

Five out of 10 provinces saw starts rise, with Ontario making up the most significant share of new starts at nearly 89,000 units, up by about 11,000 starts. The Prairies region also had strong growth, increasing by 3,700 units in May from April to about 56,000 starts on an annualized basis, led by Alberta, the TD report stated.

The report noted that despite cooling resales and prices in many parts of the country, builders continue to add supply “at a very healthy clip” due in part to the lag between development and quick-shifting residential market conditions.

Strong activity, it added, should continue for the rest of the year based on elevated permitting data. Yet starts are forecast to trend lower next year due to higher financing costs, including mortgages, that will weigh on Canadian homebuilders."
24,"As average 30-year fixed mortgage rates continue to hover around 6%, there’s an expectation that prices of homes for sale will fall. It’s only been 10 days since the Fed increased interest rates so it’s too soon to see the impact. 

Or is it?

So begins week two of What’s Working’s focus on housing (Missed the first issue? Check it out). There’s still job news below, so scroll down if local housing costs aren’t a concern. See below for … robot jobs!

On Monday, the average list price for a house for sale in Denver was $742,773. Three days later it dropped 2.9% to $721,517, according to multiple listing data provided by Opendoor. Meanwhile, during the same three days, the median closing price fell $26,000, or 4%, to $619,000.

But pay close attention homeowners: The $619,000 price tag in June is still 13.6% higher than median closing prices a year ago in June. And, added a spokesperson for Opendoor, “It’s important to note that the median price hasn’t changed.” 

Things are moving so quickly, said Nicole Bachaud, a senior economist at housing site Zillow. 

“We had this huge acceleration, this huge boost in spring of 2020 that continued into 2021 that was the strongest year for housing that we’ve really ever seen,” Bachaud said. “Now we’re coming to this period where things are going to cool down really fast as well. And that’s going to look like whiplash for a lot of buyers and sellers in the market.”

However, she added, “the markets are not going to crash, we’re not going to see this huge drop in home values across the board. But it’s gonna look very different than it did in December of 2021.”

And why is that? There’s still demand from consumers to buy a house. Also the number of new homes getting started has dropped off. “What we really need in order to curb this home-price growth is more homes,” she said. “And (would-be) sellers are feeling locked into their current interest rate. If you refinanced at 3%, selling and buying at a 6% rate doesn’t seem like such a good deal right now.”

Price cuts in for-sale houses have been happening for weeks, months and even years in Colorado, according to Zillow data. Even when sales were the strongest last year, there were still houses that cut their price for one reason or another, likely because they were asking too much. 

Zillow data for the Colorado Springs, Denver and Fort Collins markets do show that there’s been a sharp increase in the number of houses that cut the list price within the past month. The chart below shows that in early June, 9.17% of the homes for sale in Denver dropped their price in the past month, while 9.1% did in Colorado Springs and 3.37% did in Fort Collins:

Those price discounts in Denver rose to a median of $19,000 in early June, nearly double the amount in January. Colorado Springs price cuts weren’t as sharp and had dropped to $11,050 in early June, while Fort Collins hit $19,201.

Consider it an interest rate silver lining for house hunters forced to save their money after getting outbid on every house in the past year. But it’s not like house prices are falling. They’re just not growing as fast as last year and the real estate industry already expects that the days of multiple offers on a house are over for now. 

6%? Bah! Interest rates have been higher
“My first house mortgage was at 14%,” Craig Aberle, a reader who wrote this week in response to last week’s story that renting is cheaper than buying. “It was still a good deal financially.” 

Aberle, who lives in Denver, pointed out the many benefits of owning a house today even as interest rates rise. There are tax deductions, equity and loan refinancing when rates do fall, as they did last year when they dipped below 3%.

“Rates at 5% or 6% are modest,” he said.

This isn’t the first time in recent history that mortgage rates hit 6%.

A notable period for mortgage rates were the 1980s, when rates were super high — in the teens, according to the Federal Reserve economic data. The peak of 16.64% in 1981 makes today’s 6% a bargain. For people who bought homes in 2018 or earlier, current interest rates are just a return to earlier times.

However, new budgets and increasing housing prices make buying homes for new homeowners nonetheless inaccessible. Housing prices have gone way up in the past five decades. 

“Homes were a lot cheaper back then. So a 16% interest rate was maybe the difference of tens or hundreds of dollars a month, and not thousands of dollars a month,” Bachaud said. “A home is a very different type of purchase than it was decades ago.”

The typical Colorado home value of $126,900 in the 1980s is drastically different from the typical home value of $604,065 reported in May Zillow data. That’s a 376% increase. After running it through a quick inflation calculator, that $126,900 home would be roughly $408,057 now considering recent inflation — a relative steal in a housing market seeing prices upward of $700,000.

Historic developments in homeownership add another dimension to the story. In the years after the hike in interest rates in the 80s, homeownership rates in Colorado dipped to a historic low of 58.6%. That’s little more than half of tracked Colorodans living and owning a home according to U.S. Census data. 

The most recent data show homeownership rates slowly rising to a rate 64.9% in 2020. With how volatile the housing market has been recently, and as many communities are unable to catch up with zooming home prices, we’ll see how homeownership rates change in coming months. 

The benefits of owning are certainly more than what the monthly mortgage payment is. But buyers may not see those for several years, said Bachaud, with Zillow.

“If you’re going to buy something or rent something for two years, the cost of purchasing and selling real estate is pretty high. You’re dealing with transfer taxes, real estate taxes, closing costs and buyer and seller commissions. All of those things make it really expensive,” she said. “For the short term, renting is cheaper.”

But wait. Housing prices are still high. Affordability is low
Workers are being priced out of their homes, according to a recent report by the Regional Economic Development Institute at Colorado State University, which measured workers’ abilities to afford two-bedroom apartments without becoming rent burdened. That’s when individuals need to spend more than a third of their income to pay for rent. Thanks to Kendall Stephenson, one of the authors of the report, for sending this along! 

Workers in Fort Collins, a city with a population of around 170,000, have become increasingly rent burdened over the past decade. In 2010, 36% of all occupations could not afford fair market rent. Now, as of 2020, it’s 52%. 

In particular, food preparation and serving occupations face one of the greatest disparities in keeping up with fair market rent. Waiters and waitresses in Fort Collins have a median hourly wage of $12.01. If they wanted to afford rent at fair market prices, they’d need to make almost double their current wages, or $23.92 per hour. Conversely, in 2010 waiters and waitresses would have needed only an hourly increase of about $2 to afford fair market rent. 

Health care support occupations are another group that saw a hit at housing affordability. Not only that, but women are disproportionately impacted. Over 70% of people within these jobs are female, and employees would need to see raises of about 50% to be able to afford fair market rent in Fort Collins. 

Fort Collins workers’ wages are not keeping up with the increase in fair market rent, and as a result many low-wage earners are forced to commute into Fort Collins for work, the REDI report showed. Although workers are able to save on housing, skyrocketing fuel prices take a toll on their expenses.  

Inflation watch: Gas tax relief?
If staying the same is a sign that inflation is deflating, Colorado gas prices didn’t budge this week, ending at an average of $4.905 for a gallon of regular on Friday. U.S. prices fell back below last week’s $5 mark, which was a national record, according to AAA. The price of crude oil — which is refined and made into gasoline for cars — declined, due to “concern regarding the potential for economic growth,” AAA said.

But the per-gallon price is still higher than a month ago, when it was $4.166.

On Wednesday, President Joe Biden asked Congress to suspend the federal gas tax for 90 days. That would reduce the cost of a fuel by 18 cents on a gallon of regular gas and 24 cents on diesel. 

If Colorado paused its own gas taxes, which Biden asked all states to do, that could save drivers another 22 cents a gallon.

Gov. Jared Polis doesn’t appear to be considering doing this, at least not yet.  

“If gas prices are still high on the global market when the state legislature returns he would be supportive of additional gas fee relief as long as road funding is backfilled from other sources, but the federal relief is larger and … can immediately save 18-24 cents a gallon for consumers,” Conor Cahill, a spokesman for the governor’s office, wrote in an email.

Cahill also pointed out that Polis backed the delay of a new 2-cent gas fee plus an $11.30 reduction in vehicle registration fees this year. 

“There is no one silver bullet to help Coloradans during this time of rising costs but the governor has led the way on saving people money and is thrilled Washington, D.C., is finally going to act and of course the governor would be open to additional ways to save people money including suspending gas fees and taxes so long as the state legislature didn’t take the money from needed road repairs,” Cahill wrote.

→ Who saves money on a gas tax pause? Not 100% of savings were passed to consumers, according to a University of Pennsylvania Wharton School study, Politico reported. When Maryland, Georgia and Connecticut paused their gas tax, the tax savings passed to customers was between 58% to 87%. Also: If the federal gas tax was suspended from March to December, researchers concluded that the average person would save $16 and $47 on gas while lowering federal tax revenue by $20 billion.

 The (makers of) robots need help!
The artificially intelligent lawn-cutting company Scythe Robotics in Boulder is hoping its zero-emissions approach to landscaping (i.e.: the lawn mowers are electric) will change an industry. 

And it’s hiring. 

But not lawn crews. The 4-year-old startup needs software test engineers, mobile developers and, less specific, people who “Love robots? Reach out!”  Scythe recently added talent from Space X.

The half-ton Scythe M.52 autonomous lawn mowers, scheduled to roll out this year, were developed to be smart enough to tackle slopes, avoid obstacles and react to grass thickness on the spot. But the reason the company already has 5,000 orders is likely due to the labor shortage in landscape workers, said Jack Morrison, who met his fellow cofounders Davis Foster and Isaac Roberts while working on computer vision and 3D-scanning technologies at Replica Labs.

“One day while I was mowing my lawn, the idea struck me, ‘Why am I still doing this?’ Mowing is pretty dull and dirty, and with the new technologies that were emerging at the time, it’s something a robot could do,” Morrison said in an email. “As we looked into it, we found that the landscaping industry has been plagued by a massive labor shortage that robotic mowers could help alleviate. We also learned how polluting gas-powered landscaping equipment is, so we built ours with electric power so that as landscapers maintain more green spaces with M.52, they can also do so more sustainably.”

The venture-backed business, which has raised $18.6 million from investors to date, targets commercial landscaping businesses allowing a novel approach to how much it charges for the machines. There’s not a per-mower cost. Rather, it charges per acre mowed, so more like a lease.

That may be key to getting a new robot mower to gain an audience of legacy landscapers who are spared from an upfront investment in artificial intelligence. The usage-based pricing model, according to Scythe, “is saving customers 40% on their mowing costs.” 

Scythe employs 40 people but is apparently planning to hire much more. One of its newest hires is Jen Mongeois as head of talent acquisition. At her old company, she hired 500 people in five years.

25,"Pierce County announcement.

The latest assessed values for residential and commercial properties throughout Pierce County are in the mail to taxpayers and posted on the Assessor-Treasurer’s website.

“Home values in all parts of our County continue to increase dramatically, typically by a startling countywide average of around $80,000 each in the past year,” said Mike Lonergan, Pierce County Assessor-Treasurer. Overall, residential properties went up over 19 percent this year, compared to 16 percent in 2021, due to a continued hot real estate market.

Lonergan cautioned homeowners not to jump to the conclusion that a large increase in value will result in a large tax increase, because state law limits the amount taxes can go up without a vote of the people. “It’s a math equation,” he said,” and when values are rising, the legal limits on each taxing district will reduce their tax rates per thousand dollars of value.”

“Your property tax in 2023 will be the new 2022 value multiplied by the combined tax rates of your school district, city, fire district and so forth, added to the statewide school levy that everyone pays,” Lonergan explained. “So a lot depends on public votes in your local districts, such as levy lid lifts and bond issues.”

While home values are all up sharply, the change varies in different communities, based on actual sales of similar properties. “The 18.4 percent increase in Tacoma was near the County average, bringing the typical Tacoma residence to $493,000, an increase of $77,000,” Lonergan explained. “By contrast Edgewood’s increase was the lowest at 12.9 percent, or $69,000, for an average 2022 residential value of $604,000.”

As COVID-19 restrictions eased, most commercial properties showed slight value increases, with the exception of hotels which remained unchanged. Retail, restaurants and office space each went up around five percent, while apartment buildings and warehouses both showed another year of double-digit increases, due to continuing demand for affordable housing and online ordering/distribution.

Any property owner who believes the Assessor-Treasurer has over-valued their property may appeal to the Pierce County Board of Equalization at no cost. The appeal must be filed no later than August 23, 2022, providing evidence that comparable properties have sold recently at a lower amount.

26,"Houston mortgage payments have grown 46.4%, as housing affordability hits a 15-year low, according to a new report. 

Zillow’s latest market report found rising mortgage costs, along with skyrocketing prices and interest rates have made mortgages less affordable than they’ve been since 2007. 

The hit to affordability has lessened demand, eased price growth, slowed sales and boosted inventory, according to the report. 

In early June, mortgage rates averaged 5.78%, bringing the monthly mortgage payment on a typical home to $2,127, 51% higher than last year.

Mortgage payments on a typical Houston-area home are $2,032 a month, based on last week’s mortgage rates. That’s up 46.4% compared to May 2021.

Zillow economist Nicole Bachuad said mortgage rates took an unprecedented leap skyward over the past two weeks and quickly multiplied housing costs as they rose.

“We are already seeing signs of waning demand and expect these recent rate hikes to quicken the market’s needed rebalancing,” she said. “While shoppers will likely experience less competition for homes than the frenzied recent months, their purchasing power has dwindled.”  

While inventory continues to recover from its February low, it’s still 50% below 2019 levels. 

With incomes lagging behind the fast-growing mortgage costs, homeowners are facing the most serious affordability challenges they’ve seen in the past 15 years. Data from April showed monthly mortgage payments amount to 28% of a homeowner’s monthly income. 

The typical Houston home is worth $306,192, up 23.2% year over year.

And while rents are also increasing, rising mortgage costs still make renting a cheaper option throughout the U.S., according to Zillow. Mortgage payments are higher than rent in 45 of the 50 largest U.S. metros, up from 22 in 2019. 

The typical monthly rent in Houston is $1,575, up 11.7% from May 2021.

Zillow also found that price appreciation is starting to slow, and after setting new record highs for the past 13 months, it caused home values to turn a corner last month, when they registered a slower annual growth path of 20.7%, down from April’s 20.9% in a sign that demand is finally lessening. 

The typical home is worth $659,089, up 15% year over year and 34.2% since 2019.

“Arriving in the middle of the spring selling season, this deceleration is a clear signal that buyers are dialing back their demand for homes in the face of daunting affordability challenges,” said Jeff Tucker, senior economist at Zillow.  

That trend, according to the report, shows the high-velocity rate of price increases seen over the last year is beginning to slow."

29,"Miami-Dade County real estate posted its 10th-highest total existing home sales month in history and its second-best May sales month ever, according to the MIAMI Association of Realtors (MIAMI) and the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) system.

MIAMI, June 23, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Miami-Dade County real estate posted its 10th-highest total existing home sales month in history and its second-best May sales month ever, according to the MIAMI Association of Realtors (MIAMI) and the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) system.

""The rapid rise in mortgage rates, from an average of 3% to 6% over the past six months, is tempering Miami real estate's historic pace,"" MIAMI Chairman of the Board Fernando Arencibia Jr. said. ""Although top sales marks are still being achieved, higher rates are starting to restore balance to the market. For the first time since July 2019, Miami single-family home inventory rose year-over-year. Look for fewer bidding wars, more days on market and a cooling of the growth-rate of pricing in the months ahead.""

Second-Best May Sales Month in History
Miami total closed sales in May 2022 outperformed nearly every other May in history despite higher mortgage rates, lower supply, and higher sale prices.

Miami's May 2022 total home sales decreased year-over-year (3,198 in May 2022 vs. 3,536 in May 2021) but performed significantly higher than every May outside of May 2021.

Miami existing condo sales decreased 7.9% year-over-year, from 2,176 in record-breaking May 2021 to 2,005 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates. Single-family home sales decreased 12.3% year-over-year, from 1,360 in record-breaking May 2021 to 1,193 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates.

The May 2021 sales total surged so high because it benefited from 3% mortgage rates, higher supply (particularly in condos) and pandemic-driven demand.

Many of the homes that sold in May 2022 had their rates established in March and April when mortgage rates were at 5%. 2018 marked the last time mortgage rates were at the level.

Housing is sensitive to rising mortgage rates. Nevertheless, Miami May 2022 total home sales finished 21.9% higher than May 2018 (3,198 vs. 2,622).

The May 2022 total home sales count finishes as the 10th-highest total home sales month in Miami-Dade County history. The top-10 highest total sales months have been achieved in the last two years. June 2021 remains No. 1 with 4,057 total home transactions in a single month.

Mid-Market $400K-$600K Condo Sales Jump
Miami existing condo sales priced between $400K to $600K increased 29.9% year-over-year to 426 transactions in May 2022. Miami single-family homes priced between $400K to $600K decreased 4.5% year-over-year to 447 transactions in May 2022, due to lack of inventory.

Mid-market condo sales are increasing because that's where the higher inventory is. There are 2.6 months of supply for condos priced between $400K to $600K. That's the third-highest price range in supply, following $1M plus (6.2 months of supply) and $600K to $999,999 (3.9 months). Demand is so high that if Miami had more supply, it would have more sales.

Global buyers are also major condo buyers. With global vaccinations rising and unstable political situations around the world, South Florida is seeing an increase in foreign homebuyers.

Vaccinated foreigners were allowed to resume travel to the U.S. back in November 2021 and that is leading to more international investment in South Florida – the No. 1 destination in the U.S. for foreign buyers. Global buyers purchase in Miami because Miami is a world-class global city with better real estate prices than other similar global cities. Foreign buyers feel at home with our incredible diversity and acceptance of all cultures, along with all our amenities.

Miami Luxury Condo Sales Rise
Miami existing condo luxury ($1-million-and-up) sales rose 8.8% year-over-year in May 2022 to 322 transactions, which are in a record-high range. Miami single-family luxury transactions decreased 5.1% year-over-year to 258 sales in May 2022 because of low inventory.

Miami luxury condos boast an inventory of 6.2 months of supply, portending more future growth in the sector given the high demand. There are 4.8 months of supply in luxury single-family homes.

Homebuyers leaving tax-burdened states to purchase in Florida (no state income tax), new-to-market firms moving here, low interest rates, the appeal of property as an inflation hedge, rising wages and accrued savings in lockdowns, strong equity market performance, a reassessment of housing needs and lifestyles because of the pandemic and expansion of remote work are all factors driving South Florida real estate demand.

Rising Mortgage Rates Should Eventually Slow Price Growth Nationally, in Miami
Home prices are determined by supply and demand. Lower supply and higher demand create higher prices. Demand for Miami real estate is at all-time highs. Inventory for Miami single-family homes (2.2 months) and condos (2.5 months) are low.

Locally, the greater share of Miami luxury sales is also part of the reason for the large year-over-year increase in median prices.

To battle national inflation, the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised rates this year and has plans for more hikes. High inflation and the Fed's tightening policy are the main drivers behind rising mortgage rates.

Mortgage rates have risen from 3% in January to 6% in June. On the same $300,000 mortgage, the monthly payment has risen from $1265 in December to $1800 today, according to NAR.

According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 5.23% in May, up from 4.98% in April. The average commitment rate across all of 2021 was 2.96%.

The mortgage rate is projected to land at 5.3% by 4Q 2022, according to NAR. That is still low compared to an all-time average of about 8% in the U.S.

Long term, the hope is higher rates will lead to more days on the market (gives buyers more choices). Higher rates will eventually lead to a moderation of the growth rate of pricing. With the growth rate of pricing cooling, total inventory could grow later. Historically, inventory expands six months after rates rise, but today's market is unlike any other.

Miami home prices haven't begun to moderate because inventory is low. Also, one of the supports for home prices is rents and rents are rising strongly.

Miami-Dade County single-family home median prices increased 15% year-over-year in May 2022, increasing from $500,000 to $575,000. Miami single-family median prices have risen for 126 consecutive months (10.5 years), the longest running-streak on record. Existing condo median prices increased 27.7% year-over-year, from $325,000 to $415,000. Condo median prices have increased in 128 of the last 132 months.

Single-Family Home Inventory Rises for the First Time Since July 2019
Inventory of single-family homes increased 0.2% year-over-year in May 2022 from 2,784 active listings last year to 2,790 last month. Condominium inventory decreased 43.8% year-over-year to 5,024 from 8,946 listings during the same period in 2021.

New listings of Miami single-family homes decreased a negligible 0.7% to 1,813 from 1,826. New listings of condominiums decreased 3%, from 2,598 to 2,521.

Months' supply of inventory for single-family homes stayed even at 2.2 months year-over-year, which indicates a seller's market. Inventory for existing condominiums decreased 58.3% to 2.5 months, which also indicates a seller's market. A balanced market between buyers and sellers offers between six- and nine-months supply.

Total active listings at the end of May 2022 decreased 33% year-over-year, from 11,730 to 7,814.

Nationally, total housing inventory at the end of May was 1,160,000 units, an increase of 12.6% from April and a 4.1% decline from the previous year (1.21 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.2 months in April and 2.5 months in May 2021.

Miami Real Estate Had a $359.8 Million Local Economic Impact Just in May 2022
Every time a home is sold it impacts the economy: income generated from real estate industries (commissions, fees and moving expenses), expenditures related to home purchase (furniture and remodeling expenses), multiplier of housing related expenditures (income earned as a result of a home sale is re-circulated into the economy) and new construction (additional home sales induce added home production).

The total economic impact of a typical Florida home sale is $112,500, according to NAR. Miami-Dade County sold 3,198 homes in May 2022 and had a local economic impact of $359.8 million.

Miami total dollar volume totaled $2.81 billion in May 2022. Single-family home dollar volume decreased 8.31% year-over-year, from $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion. Condo dollar volume increased 3% year-over-year, from $1.47 billion to $1.51 billion.

Miami Distressed Sales Keep Dropping, Reflecting Healthy Market
Only 1.2% of all closed residential sales in Miami were distressed last month, including REO (bank-owned properties) and short sales, lower than the 1.7% in May 2021. In 2009, distressed sales comprised 70% of Miami sales.

Total Miami distressed sales decreased 35% year-over-year in May 2022, from 60 to 39. Short sales and REOs accounted for 0.5% and 0.8% year-over-year, respectively, of total Miami sales in May 2022. Short sale transactions decreased 44.2% year-over-year while REOs decreased 11.8%.

Miami's percentage of distressed sales are on par with the national figure. Nationally, distressed sales represented less than 1% of sales in May 2022, unchanged from May 2021

Miami's Percentage of Sales Continue to Outpace the Nation, State
In Florida, closed sales of single-family homes statewide totaled 28,861, down 6.9% year-over-year, while existing condo-townhouse sales totaled 13,265 down 14.4% over 15,491 in May 2021. Closed sales may occur from 30- to 90-plus days after sales contracts are written.

Nationally, total existing-home sales transactions completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, fell 3.4% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.41 million in May. Year-over-year, sales receded 8.6% (5.92 million in May 2021).

The statewide median sales price for single-family existing homes was $420,000 up 21.8% from the previous year, according to data from Florida Realtors Research Department in partnership with local Realtor boards/associations. Last month's statewide median price for condo-townhouse units was $322,000, up 28.8% over the year-ago figure. The median is the midpoint; half the homes sold for more, half for less.

Nationally, the median existing-home price all housing types in May was $407,600, up 14.8% from May 2021 ($355,000), as prices increased in all regions. This marks 123 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.

Miami Real Estate Attracting Multiple Bids, Buyers Going Over-List Price
The median percent of original list price received for single-family homes was 100% in May 2022, up 1.3% from 98.7% last year. The median percent of original list price received for existing condominiums was 100%, up 4.4% from 95.8% last year.

The median number of days between listing and contract dates for Miami single-family home sales was 14 days, a 22.2% decrease from 18 days last year. The median time to sale for single-family homes was 58 days, a 13.4% decrease from 67 days last year.

The median number of days between the listing date and contract date for condos was 21 days, down 57.1% from 49 days. The median number of days to sale for condos was 67 days, a 28.7% decrease from 94 days.

Miami Cash Sales 77.6% More than National Figure in May 2022
Cash sales represented 44.4% of Miami closed sales in May 2022, compared to 38.9% in May2021. About 25% of U.S. home sales are made in cash, according to the latest NAR statistics.

Cash buyers are not deterred by rising rates.

The high percentage of cash buyers reflects Miami's top position as the preeminent American real estate market for foreign buyers, who tend to purchase with all cash as well as some moving from more expensive U.S. markets who can buy more with their profits from real estate sales.

Cash sales accounted for 52.7% of all Miami existing condo sales and 30.4% of single-family transactions."
30,"By now, you probably already feel the pinch. As more and more people move to Texas, the least surprising thing ever is happening in Dallas: Rents are skyrocketing.

The Texas Realtors 2021 Relocation Report found that between 537,000 and 582,000 people moved to Texas in 2019, and the state ranked second overall in relocation activity in the same year. But with this influx of new people comes the problem of where they are going to live, and demand is now higher than supply.

“The influx of people moving to our area is a big part of our increased demand and keeping up continues to be a struggle,” Phil Crone, the executive officer for the Dallas Builders Association, said by email. “For example, we have been building between 20-25k apartment units a year pretty consistently, but occupancy rates are still really high, around 95-96%.”

In May, according to the Dallas-based real estate technology firm RealPage, the average rental price in North Texas had risen 17.5% year over year, as reported by The Dallas Morning News. In Dallas, the average rent clocked in at $1,526 a month.

Texas isn’t just attracting people, though; companies are setting up shop here too. And institutional buyers, which include companies and corporations, bought 43% of homes sold in Dallas County last year, according to a report by the National Association of Realtors.

According to Forbes, Texas has some of the most “business-friendly policies in the U.S.,” and in 2021, “some 62 companies relocated their HQs to Texas from 17 states and three countries.”

Meanwhile, builders can’t keep up with demand in part due to ongoing supply chain problems.

“[Getting new materials] is a massive industry-wide problem, and it feels like we are still playing whack-a-mole with it,” Crone said. “Lumber prices are improving as well as appliances. However, siding products are on allocation, builders are waiting six months for windows and some brick and siding products are on allocation. If you can get them, they may need to be shipped across the country with $6 per gallon diesel.”

When building new apartment complexes costs more money than usual, owners charge higher rates to tenants to recoup those costs.

The Real Deal, a Texas real estate news site, reported that bidding wars for rent prices are now happening around the state: Owners are asking applicants to submit their best offer in order to get the highest possible rent payments for the properties.

Ian Mattingly, one of the owners and managers of the Apartment Association of Greater Dallas, said problems in the supply chain can affect the costs of providing safe, quality rental housing.

“We buy a lot of the same types of products that developers buy, that builders buy, that single family homeowners buy,” said Mattingly, who is also president at the Luma Residential property management firm. “Those are currently the same types of products that are most impacted by supply chain disruptions. So that’s everything from refrigerators, dishwashers, lumber, drywall, lightbulbs, all of these kinds of things we’ve seen, really, really significant cost input increases.”

Mattingly added that the record cost of energy, which started spiking during the 2021 Texas freeze, also accounts for price increases. “All of that contributes to this record growth in what we would call our operating expenses,” he said.

Building materials and energy costs aren’t the only thing going up. Property values in Texas are spiking, driving property taxes up. Because rental properties are taxed as commercial properties, they are not eligible for single-family homeowner exclusions.

“We have some of the highest property taxes per capita of any state in the country,” Mattingly said of Texas. “Property taxes can be 20-25% of our cost inputs, so you know, if eight or nine cents out of every dollar is profit … 20-25 cents out of every dollar is just going to pay the local property taxing authorities.”

But no matter what the problems are, prices for rental properties in Texas are going up, and it is getting more difficult for tenants needing housing to find something affordable.

Although Crone thinks the ""days of runaway property values"" might have passed now, he worries that development companies are using up available land too quickly for project approvals to keep up.

“The pandemic era has made that go from bad to worse,"" he said. ""The biggest victims here are the tens of thousands of families no longer able to find attainable new housing in any form. This market has thrived on being more attainable than others so I'd argue these pricing and supply concerns hurt DFW more than anywhere else.”"
31,"Homebuyers don’t have to venture outside of Dallas to live the lake life. With White Rock Lake located inside the city limits, residents have an ideal place to enjoy waterside fun all year.

The allure of long walks or after-school bike rides along White Rock Lake Trail remains strong for prospective buyers in Lakewood and East Dallas. The real estate market continues to be brisk in these neighborhoods hugging the water.

To find out what’s available and what has sold lately, connect with an expert at Allie Beth Allman & Associates. The firm represents buyers and sellers in the area and has a list of private offerings to share.

The custom-built brick home at 7011 Wildgrove Ave. is available through Kendall Coleman. Its architectural details include a vaulted ceiling in the den, a tin ceiling in the dining room and fireplaces inside and out.

In addition to the walkability to White Rock Lake and the YMCA, the home offers a wine cellar and tasting room, pool, hot tub, covered patio with an outdoor kitchen and a turfed backyard.

In May, the estate at 6722 Lakeshore Drive listed with Richard Graziano for the first time in 26 years and it didn’t take long for the property to change hands.

Dating to 1939, the residence was meticulously updated for modern living. The new owner can relish its outdoor living spaces, landscaping and gracious interior. For a housewarming party, the kitchen and separate prep kitchen will come in handy.

For those who like a more contemporary aesthetic, the home designed by architect Bentley Tibbs at 6939 Pasadena Ave. might be just right. The open floor plan with clean lines and large walls for artwork creates a casual, yet sophisticated atmosphere. Poised for entertaining, the property offers a backyard oasis with a pool, a family room with a wet bar and refrigerator and an expansive kitchen with an island. Alan Smith is marketing the home, which has four bedrooms and a three-car garage.

Recently, Gia Marshello helped her clients find and buy the home at 7022 Lakeshore Drive. The new owners are coming home to plenty of fun, starting with a game room with a bar-kitchen, the well-equipped kitchen with a nugget ice maker, the screened-in porch, the pool and the dual-zone wine cellar. Transformed in 2015, this 6,098-square-foot residence’s list of highlights goes on and on and White Rock Lake is steps away."
32,"Investors in Dallas-Fort Worth flipped 2,600 homes and condos in the first quarter, more than double the number a year earlier, according to data from Attom Data Solutions.

That’s double the number of homes flipped in North Texas a year ago and represents 13 percent of all sales in DFW, the Dallas Morning News reported. Attom defines a flip as a property that has had multiple transactions within the past 12 months.

“The good news for fix-and-flip investors is that demand remains strong from prospective homebuyers, as evidenced by this quarter’s report, which shows that one of every 10 homes sold during Q1 was a flip,” said Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence for Attom Data Solutions, in a statement.

Pending home sales are still on the rise in DFW and other cities, and the number of flips in the area has increased 133 percent from last year. Rising home prices have helped fiel the flippers’ market. In May, the three-month moving average of home prices in the Dallas-Fort Worth market was up by about 17 percent from a year earlier.

“The bad news is that rising mortgage interest rates are beginning to slow down home price appreciation rates, and buyers have become more selective — and less willing to outbid other buyers for properties they’re interested in,” Sharga said.

Mortgage rates in North Texas reached a record 6 percent earlier this month, which is pricing many new homebuyers out of the market. This has led to a further decline in overall home sales for the North Texas region, which in March dropped 93 percent from the same time last year.

Dallas-Fort Worth was one of the few markets in the U.S. that saw an uptick in sales margins from last year, according to the publication, going up about 11 percent. On a national scale, flips represented about 10 percent of all home sales, and gross margins for investors dropped to their lowest point since 2009.

California-based data firm Kukun reported in a separate analysis that low inventory and strong price growth across the U.S. may have been the catalyst that compelled speculators to hop on this trend and hold onto homes to resell them rather than renovate them.

The report found that flippers have seen little to no returns above general home price appreciation while more homes are being flipped in shorter periods of time, and that flippers applied for building permits for renovations at near the lowest rate on record in the first quarter. Kukun reported that only about 14 percent of flippers in Dallas-Fort Worth applied for permits on their properties as of March 2022.

“While not definitive, we believe these are some of the first signs of speculation in the U.S. housing market since the Great Recession,” Kukun said in the report.

They also noted that while some flippers may have entered the market with the intent to renovate, shortages in contractors and materials may have compelled them to pursue smaller projects that did not require permits.

The National Association of Realtors reported that 43 percent of homes in Dallas County were purchased by investors, companies and corporation last year, ranking seventh nationwide. It was followd up by four other Texas counties, including Rockwall county ranked fourth at 45 percent and Tarrant County ranked third at 52."
33,"Once considered an afterthought or a bonus space, outdoor living areas are now more mainstream, and a desirable feature among many of today’s home buyers. One driving force behind the trend is the pandemic-induced shift in priorities when it comes to the home. Updating your property with a deck or other outdoor room that is fun as well as functional not only expands your usable living area now, it also adds value if you decide to put your home on the market.

According to the Remodeling 2022 Cost vs. Value Report, the average cost to add a wood deck to a property is about $19,000, and homeowners can expect to recuperate nearly 65 percent of that cost when selling their home. This estimate is for a 16 by 20-foot deck with pressure-treated joists and planks. A composite deck is slightly more expensive, but it also brings in an excellent return on investment (ROI) of about 62 percent.

Along with a deck, there are many other features to consider when updating your outdoor living space—from landscaping to sun protection to accessory buildings and more. We’ve put together a collection of articles that cover everything you need to know about refreshing your yard, whether you’re planning to sell your home in the near future or simply looking to spruce it up for your own enjoyment. The following ideas, cost estimates, shopping guides, tutorials, and other important considerations will help you plan an outdoor living space update that’s right for your home and budget.

Deck
Installing a new deck (or replacing an old one) is one of the most impactful projects homeowners can do to improve their backyard. When planning this addition, however, there are countless decisions to be made, from the type of materials used to the square footage and aesthetic design. It’s important to consider how much money you want to invest as well as how much maintenance the deck will require after it’s built. Consult the guides below to learn about the pros and cons of different decking materials, how much the project costs on average, as well as how to design, build, and maintain a deck yourself.

Patio

A patio is a popular alternative to a deck, as it’s typically cheaper to build and easier to maintain over time. Like a deck, a patio can function as an outdoor living room suitable for entertaining, or it can simply be a place for relaxing in the open air when the weather is nice. If you’re considering a patio for your backyard, one of the most important decisions to make is the material. Pavers or a simple concrete slab are two popular choices today, and each comes with different costs and installation methods as well as different aesthetics.

Shade

Planning a covered outdoor living space is prudent in warmer climates where shade is necessary on hot, sunny days. Adding cover to a deck or patio can be done in a number of different ways, from pergolas and gazebos to awnings and shade sails. For a more natural look, you could even consider planting fast-growing shade trees in strategic locations around the yard. The following articles provide outdoor living ideas that will inspire you to add sun protection to your landscape.

Landscaping

When selling a home, it’s important to make a good first impression. Great landscaping not only provides curb appeal for prospective buyers, but it also increases the value of a home. Planting trees and shrubs can improve air quality and privacy while simultaneously making an outdoor living space more aesthetically appealing. The articles below include landscaping ideas for different types of yards, cost estimates for various lawn and garden projects, and tips and tricks for planting and pruning outdoor greenery.

Accessory Building

An accessory building can add storage space and functionality to a yard, and it can even be a source of income. If you’re considering adding a shed, an accessory dwelling unit (ADU), or any other outbuilding to your property, there are a number of practical factors to keep in mind. For example, many municipalities have setback and building-permit requirements based on the type of structure you plan to add. Read up on these important considerations and more before adding an accessory building to your property."
34,"You may not have heard the term, but flat-front homes are easy enough to spot: They're the homes on your street, usually colonials, that appear one-dimensional. They lack depth, ornamental features, and landscaping, and a lack of porches and awnings paired with a homogenous color palette often defines the appearance of these homes.

""The thing about flat-front houses is that they suggest that the people who live there don't take pride in their home,"" says DC-based interior designer Annie Elliot. ""And so if you are listing your house, the one dimension really does not does not help your cause.""

Anyone with a flat-front house probably does take great pride in their home—but not knowing how to dress up a lackluster exterior will prevent even the most diligent homeowner from showing off the front yard of their dreams.

While the flat-front home problem is purely aesthetic, when it comes to selling the property, the problem can be become one of sellability. That's because curb appeal often brings potential buyers in the door. A beautiful exterior is the secret to getting potential buyers to stop scrolling home sites, peek through the rest of your photos, and make a decision to schedule a tour or put in an offer. Owning a flat-front house doesn't resign you to a lengthy selling process, though: Whether you're ready to list your home or not, there are simple ways to upgrade your flat-front home and make it the prettiest spot on the block.

Dramatic Solutions for Your Flat-Front House
If you have time and money to make over your flat-front home, there are a few areas you'll want to focus on.

Elliot suggests starting by adding dimension to the home itself. You can do this by adding shutters or awnings if they fit the style and era of the home. (Don't do this with a modern home, for example.) You can spruce up your front steps or add new ones. A walkway through the front yard to the front door will increase curb appeal, as well.

""If you don't have any approach to the house, that's something you probably want to consider,"" Elliot says. ""Try putting down brick or flagstone.""

Elliot also recommends focusing on landscaping—this is where you'll want to hire a pro.

""A front garden, curved beds—with or without stone or brick edging—they add beauty, dimension, and interest,"" Elliot says. ""So if you don't have a green thumb, engaging a landscaper is really worth every penny.""

Elliot suggests adding at least two curved beds to add depth to the yard and thinking outside the box with bushes: Flat rows of shrubs will only make the problem worse. Instead, vary the height and shape of your plantings and be sure to include some evergreen options so your landscaping stays in good shape year-round.

If you have a larger budget to play with, Elliot says a front porch will truly solve the one-dimensional problem. Adding a porch is a pricey and time-consuming fix, though, and if you're updating the house to sell it, you'll likely regret not having the porch sooner to enjoy yourself.

Budget Fixes
If you don't have the time or money to fix your flat-front house with major additions or landscaping, there are still some budget-friendly options to improve its curb appeal.

Elliot suggests going with potted plants or potted trees and spacing them a few feet in front of your front door on either side: There's no landscaping pro required for this upgrade, and you can take the plants and pots with you when you move.

""I do suggest looking at home improvement stores for resin or plastic terracotta look-alikes, which are far lighter and easier to move than concrete or metal and far less expensive,"" she says.

Paint can also go a long way to add curb appeal, Elliot says. Try redoing the front door in a bold color and painting any existing shutters with a fresh coat.

Patsy Rios Franzi, a real estate agent with Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Universal, suggests painting the trim, too. ""If there's any kind of trim around the house, making it a different contrasting color [than the siding] will really make the front of the house pop,"" she says.

Don't want to buy paint? Then elbow grease is the best route. Elliot says, at a bare minimum, you can clean your siding, sweep your porch, and straighten any loose or crooked shutters.

""Sometimes all you need is a power wash to make everything look brighter,"" she says.

Courtney Klosterman, consumer insights expert for home insurance services company Hippo, also suggests fixing driveway cracks, enhancing lighting, and replacing old gutters and downspouts. The benefit of these enhancements is that they not only improve the look of your flat-front home, but also improve the home from a safety and structure standpoint.

""Not only will this make your home look cleaner, it will be beneficial for the new homeowners,"" Klosterman says.

If you don't want to lift a finger, Rios Franzi suggests swapping exterior photos for better features in your listing.

""The first pictures are usually the front of the house,"" she says. ""But if it's really bad off, my first picture will either be of the backyard if it's really nice, or an interior photo of something like the living room.""

This should be a last resort, Rios Franzi says, because most buyers expect to see the exterior of a home before scheduling a tour.

The Return on Investment
If you make these improvements, real estate agents say you can expect to see a return on your investment.

""You'll see a return in many ways, and not necessarily in dollars,"" Rios Franzi says, adding that some upgrades might be essential to making a sale at all. At the very least, you'll increase traffic to your home from potential buyers who aren't turned off by the exterior photos.

""Everybody who passes the house with the for sale sign is a potential buyer or a potential referrer, so it is critical that the front of your house look appealing,"" Elliot says.

In a hot housing market, you might sell your home regardless of the flat-front problem, but you'll never know how much you might have fetched with increased curb appeal.

""You're lucky, because in today's market you don't need to do a lot to sell,"" Rios Franzi says. ""But I still recommend [upgrades to boost curb appeal], because it's my job to get you top dollar.""

Whatever you do, whether it's a makeover or clever listing photos, make sure you address the curb appeal factor.

""You can't ignore a flat-front house,"" Elliot says. ""That's the bottom line."""
35,"While these factors add up from the investors’ viewpoint, the final success story involves additional characters. It was easier to gauge the success or failure rate until the COVID-19 pandemic crushed the entire world, impacting not only animate humans but also inanimate things like real estate.

If you are considering a property investment, it is crucial to consider the pandemic’s impact. The global outbreak has compelled many people to rethink how long they can stay in their present homes before having to relocate to a new and safe location. 

In communities where a large number of people were infected, many individuals are considering selling their houses as a preferred option so that they do not miss out on the early profits or lack of demand down the road.

Moreover, strict norms to curb the spread of the virus have made it difficult for both property sellers and buyers to engage in frictionless transactions. Immediate repercussions include shockingly declined property sales, an abrupt increase in cost and people abandoning their properties in the metro cities, throwing the market into a depressing state.

Currently, the real estate market is in a volatile state and witnessing change on different levels. With the abrupt change in policies of governments, the real estate market is in flux, which affects its stability. Owning a property is getting more challenging for people due to the rising interest rates on mortgages.  

Still, people are looking for ways to make money with property investment. If you are one of them, then the following tips will help you create the right mindset and plan.

Select The Right Location
Selecting the right location for your next property is half the battle won. The location should cater to everyday needs by being close to grocery stores, restaurants, cafes and public transport.

By choosing the right location, you kill two birds with one stone, i.e., better resale value and higher rental income. Right location means having all the amenities nearby, which allows you to quickly sell your property once you decide to move on – best if you have a money-making mindset.

Moreover, the value of property bought in the right location and at the right time will rise over the years due to appreciation and capital growth. The demand will also grow because of new development projects like residential buildings or shopping centres being built nearby.

Get Proper Insurance
Getting the proper insurance is essential when you consider investing in a property. Insurance should not just be for your home. It is equally feasible for your next property. But the question arises – why is insurance crucial for your property?

There is a multitude of reasons for having your property insured. Without proper insurance, it will be next to impossible to get compensation for mishaps like a fire or burglary. It is safe to say you will have to bear the burden of any untoward events alone.

Also, it is recommended for landlords to get insurance by paying a small subscription fee to an insurance company today and get a guarantee in exchange. It comes in handy if you are planning to rent out your property to tenants. Insurance companies will be responsible for bearing any large and uncertain loss that may happen due to mishaps caused by tenants.

Define Your Investment Goals
Understanding your investment goals is the next big step in your path toward making a profit from your property. Defining these goals is not easy. You need to be realistic and measure your goals in the long term.

That means if you are looking for at least 20% appreciation per year, which might not be very realistic considering the property location and current circumstances, then you need to be more practical in your approach.

Also, you should stick to a time-bound strategy when it comes to investment goals. It would mean forging a strategy that includes both buying a property and selling it at the right time, allowing you to attain your investment goals more quickly and efficiently. This way, you will likely save yourself risks that might occur during your ownership period.

Lastly, you should be more specific in your investment goals, which enables you to clearly navigate your property investment journey and fulfil your goals without any fuss or additional cost. If you are clear and realistic in your investment goals, then there are good reasons to invest in property right away.

Analyse Financing Options
Analysing the available financing options will place you in a better position wherein you can better understand and anticipate the overall interest and other crucial factors. It requires extensive research on your part, so that you know the current interest rates and check their feasibility.

Checking your credit score is an essential part of this step. That is because lenders are likely to prefer individuals with satisfactory credit scores. But what if your score is not up to the mark?

Fret not. If that is the case, you should be quick to implement the steps and improve your score, which will save you during the tedious approval or pre-approval process.

Another financing option could be a home equity loan, wherein you can secure an investment property. This option usually offers around 80% of the home’s equity value, which you can use to buy your next dream property. 

Consider Long-Term Expenses
Considering long-term expenses is the next step if you are looking to accrue some financial benefits from your investment. Carefully think through the different expenses that aren’t included in the initial purchase price. These expenses include maintenance and renovation, property taxes, annual insurance charges and more.

To get an estimate of these expenses, you need to analyse the previous bills and communicate with homeowners who have been living in the neighbourhood.

Hence, it becomes all the more important to keep in mind these long-term expenses before plunging into a seemingly optimistic property investment market. That means analysing whether you will get a higher monthly rent or mortgage than the monthly cost of maintenance and repairs.

By taking into account all these factors, you can make a more informed decision that will not only be right for your investment needs but will also give you fewer headaches down the line.

Conclusion
Investing in a property can be a lucrative option once you keep these tips in mind and make your decision based on all the factors listed above. In the post-pandemic world, the outlook of property investment is gradually becoming promising, making it great even for beginner investors.

For those looking to buy property as an investment, make sure you do not put all eggs in one basket, meaning do not invest every penny in your next dream property. It might prove dangerous if your property fails to give you the desired rental income, which happens in many cases. So, place your mindset in the correct order and stay in the game for the long term to survive and win in the end."
36,"U.S. new-home sales jumped unexpectedly in May despite rising mortgage rates, while the median sales price declined.  

The pace of new single-family home sales rose 10.7% from April’s upwardly revised number to a seasonally adjusted, annual rate of 696,000, while the median sales price fell to $449,000 from April’s revised median house price of $454,700, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reported. Economists had been expecting new-home sales would fall to a rate of 588,000, according to Reuters. 

On a year-over-year basis, the pace of new-home sales in May was down 5.9%.    

“As pricing begins to show signs of softening and builder inventory increases, there is potential for sales to remain consistent at this level or possibly increase slowly through the summer — because the market remains under-built, and fewer households are putting their existing homes on the market,” RCLCO Real Estate Consulting principal Kelly Mangold said. “This decline in for-sale mobility may bode well for the rise of the build-for-rent sector, as an increasing number of households seeking a for-sale home may instead choose to rent a single-family home or townhome while they wait for market conditions to become more favorable.” 

The seasonally adjusted estimate of new homes for sale at the end of May was 444,000, representing a supply of 7.7 months at the current sales rate. In April, there were 437,000 homes for sale, representing an 8.3-month supply.       

By region, the number of new-construction homes sold was mixed, with month-over-month increases of 39.3% and 12.8% in the West and South, respectively, and decreases of 51.1% and 18.3% in the Northeast and Midwest, respectively. 

First American Deputy Chief Economist Odeta Kushi cautioned not to read too much into the surprise jump in sales. 

“The monthly increase in new-home sales beat consensus expectations, but new-home sales data is volatile and one month does not make a trend,” she said in a press release. “While the nation continues to face a housing shortage, new-home sales may slow as worsening affordability and higher construction costs take a toll on the new-home market.”"
37,"Despite a cooling demand, the prices for Virginia homes continues to climb, according to Virginia REALTORS®.

The statewide median sales prices for a home in May was $401,082, up 8.7 percent from one year ago.

This is the first time Virginia’s median home price has climbed beyond the $400,000 mark.

In May 2022, 13,048 homes were sold in Virginia, an 8.5 percent decrease from last year.

While sales activity rose between April and May, Virginia REALTORS® reports this is due to a typical seasonal bump.

Nearly all regions in Virginia are experiencing a cooling housing market through the first five months of the year compared to last year.

“The moderating trend we are seeing reflects not only a return to more normal levels, but also a cooling of demand from home buyers,” says Virginia REALTORS® chief economist Ryan Price. “Buyers are feeling the weight of surging home prices, high inflation, mortgage rate jumps, and an extremely competitive market with few options to choose from.”

Statewide, there were 16,875 active listings on the market at the end of May, a 5.6 percent decrease from last year. This is the smallest decline in three years.

Additionally, the number of active listings at the end of May was 9 percent higher than the end of April – an increase larger than a typical seasonal bump.

38,"Canada’s new homes market is showing strength, based on the latest data from May, with multi-family development leading the way.

Home starts data from last month outpaced analysts’ expectations with an annualized figure of 287,000 units, exceeding forecasts of a slight slowdown to 255,000 units, a recent report from CIBC Economics stated.

May’s rise in starts was driven by multi-family builds, rising by 13 per cent from the previous month. All told, multi-family starts accounted in May for about 201,000 starts per annualized rate, as noted in a separate report from TD Economics.

By comparison, single-family detached starts made up about 63,000 starts on an annualized basis, gaining four per cent in May on a month-over-month basis.

Five out of 10 provinces saw starts rise, with Ontario making up the most significant share of new starts at nearly 89,000 units, up by about 11,000 starts. The Prairies region also had strong growth, increasing by 3,700 units in May from April to about 56,000 starts on an annualized basis, led by Alberta, the TD report stated.

The report noted that despite cooling resales and prices in many parts of the country, builders continue to add supply “at a very healthy clip” due in part to the lag between development and quick-shifting residential market conditions.

Strong activity, it added, should continue for the rest of the year based on elevated permitting data. Yet starts are forecast to trend lower next year due to higher financing costs, including mortgages, that will weigh on Canadian homebuilders."
39,"A realtor says national headlines about high home prices are misleading: Edmonton is an attractive place for first-time buyers.

“When they’re speaking of market prices, they’re not speaking of Edmonton in general, they’re generalizing using the two biggest cities in Canada,” said realtor Wally Fakhreddine.


Fakhreddine says national news centres around Toronto and Vancouver. He says Alberta – and particularly Edmonton – has a lot to offer young and first-time home buyers.

“Calgary is about 30 per cent higher in price points than we are,” said Fakhreddine. “It’s very easy to get into a nice home here for around the $400,000-$500,000 mark, which is the price point for a lot of first-time home buyers.”

A recent report from Sotheby’s shows Edmonton is the second most affordable city in North America when it comes to average rent prices. Winnipeg takes the top spot.

And with young Albertans in the 20s starting to enter the housing market, the report also shows 86 per cent of those surveyed in Calgary wanted to buy a home in the city.

Fakhreddine says work opportunities are bringing people to resource-rich Alberta instead of other parts of Canada.

“Alberta has always fared better economically than other parts of the country, and Edmonton in particular because it’s the gateway to the north. And that’s what’s bringing in people from other provinces – gainful employment, not just employment.”"
40,"SAN DIEGO – The average monthly mortgage payment on a typical San Diego home is nearing $5,000, one of the most expensive rates in the country, a new Zillow market report shows.

The report, published Tuesday, found that mortgages in June are less affordable in the U.S. than at any point since 2007, due in large part to higher prices and interest rates. It has resulted in a slower housing market with greater inventory now available to potential buyers, but affordability continues to challenge the market as prices remain high and incomes lag.

Zillow economist Nicole Bachaud said in a statement that mortgage rates “took an unprecedented leap skyward over the past two weeks and quickly multiplied housing costs as they rose.”

“We are already seeing signs of waning demand, and expect these recent rate hikes to quicken the market’s needed rebalancing,” Bachaud said. “While shoppers will likely experience less competition for homes than the frenzied recent months, their purchasing power has dwindled.”

Using the Zillow Home Value Index, the typical home in San Diego recently was priced at $936,472, up more than 26% from a year ago and well above the same figure for the U.S. at $349,816, the report shows. Of the top markets in the country, the area’s monthly mortgage price of $4,857 is one of the highest, behind only San Jose ($8,664) San Francisco ($7,702) and Los Angeles ($4,870).

It’s a similar story for rent as the company’s Zillow Observed Rent Index — the area’s average of listed rents in the 40th to 60th percentile range for homes and apartments — was at $2,999. That marks a nearly 20% increase from last year.

In the U.S. in general, monthly rent prices are up almost 16% from 2021 to $1,979.

Economists with Zillow say rent prices have “soared” since the start of last year, largely in line with data from others compiling regular real estate reports. Even so, they remain the cheaper option compared to mortgage payments — including a 20% down payment, taxes and insurance — in 45 of the top 50 markets.

Mortgage rates this month were charted at 5.78%, pushing the average monthly mortgage payment in the U.S. to $2,127, a more than 50% increase from last year."
41,"Miami-Dade County real estate posted its 10th-highest total existing home sales month in history and its second-best May sales month ever, according to the MIAMI Association of Realtors (MIAMI) and the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) system.

MIAMI, June 23, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Miami-Dade County real estate posted its 10th-highest total existing home sales month in history and its second-best May sales month ever, according to the MIAMI Association of Realtors (MIAMI) and the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) system.

""The rapid rise in mortgage rates, from an average of 3% to 6% over the past six months, is tempering Miami real estate's historic pace,"" MIAMI Chairman of the Board Fernando Arencibia Jr. said. ""Although top sales marks are still being achieved, higher rates are starting to restore balance to the market. For the first time since July 2019, Miami single-family home inventory rose year-over-year. Look for fewer bidding wars, more days on market and a cooling of the growth-rate of pricing in the months ahead.""

Second-Best May Sales Month in History
Miami total closed sales in May 2022 outperformed nearly every other May in history despite higher mortgage rates, lower supply, and higher sale prices.

Miami's May 2022 total home sales decreased year-over-year (3,198 in May 2022 vs. 3,536 in May 2021) but performed significantly higher than every May outside of May 2021.

Miami existing condo sales decreased 7.9% year-over-year, from 2,176 in record-breaking May 2021 to 2,005 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates. Single-family home sales decreased 12.3% year-over-year, from 1,360 in record-breaking May 2021 to 1,193 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates.

The May 2021 sales total surged so high because it benefited from 3% mortgage rates, higher supply (particularly in condos) and pandemic-driven demand.

Many of the homes that sold in May 2022 had their rates established in March and April when mortgage rates were at 5%. 2018 marked the last time mortgage rates were at the level.

Housing is sensitive to rising mortgage rates. Nevertheless, Miami May 2022 total home sales finished 21.9% higher than May 2018 (3,198 vs. 2,622).

The May 2022 total home sales count finishes as the 10th-highest total home sales month in Miami-Dade County history. The top-10 highest total sales months have been achieved in the last two years. June 2021 remains No. 1 with 4,057 total home transactions in a single month.

Mid-Market $400K-$600K Condo Sales Jump
Miami existing condo sales priced between $400K to $600K increased 29.9% year-over-year to 426 transactions in May 2022. Miami single-family homes priced between $400K to $600K decreased 4.5% year-over-year to 447 transactions in May 2022, due to lack of inventory.

Mid-market condo sales are increasing because that's where the higher inventory is. There are 2.6 months of supply for condos priced between $400K to $600K. That's the third-highest price range in supply, following $1M plus (6.2 months of supply) and $600K to $999,999 (3.9 months). Demand is so high that if Miami had more supply, it would have more sales.

Global buyers are also major condo buyers. With global vaccinations rising and unstable political situations around the world, South Florida is seeing an increase in foreign homebuyers.

Vaccinated foreigners were allowed to resume travel to the U.S. back in November 2021 and that is leading to more international investment in South Florida – the No. 1 destination in the U.S. for foreign buyers. Global buyers purchase in Miami because Miami is a world-class global city with better real estate prices than other similar global cities. Foreign buyers feel at home with our incredible diversity and acceptance of all cultures, along with all our amenities.

Miami Luxury Condo Sales Rise
Miami existing condo luxury ($1-million-and-up) sales rose 8.8% year-over-year in May 2022 to 322 transactions, which are in a record-high range. Miami single-family luxury transactions decreased 5.1% year-over-year to 258 sales in May 2022 because of low inventory.

Miami luxury condos boast an inventory of 6.2 months of supply, portending more future growth in the sector given the high demand. There are 4.8 months of supply in luxury single-family homes.

Homebuyers leaving tax-burdened states to purchase in Florida (no state income tax), new-to-market firms moving here, low interest rates, the appeal of property as an inflation hedge, rising wages and accrued savings in lockdowns, strong equity market performance, a reassessment of housing needs and lifestyles because of the pandemic and expansion of remote work are all factors driving South Florida real estate demand.

Rising Mortgage Rates Should Eventually Slow Price Growth Nationally, in Miami
Home prices are determined by supply and demand. Lower supply and higher demand create higher prices. Demand for Miami real estate is at all-time highs. Inventory for Miami single-family homes (2.2 months) and condos (2.5 months) are low.

Locally, the greater share of Miami luxury sales is also part of the reason for the large year-over-year increase in median prices.

To battle national inflation, the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised rates this year and has plans for more hikes. High inflation and the Fed's tightening policy are the main drivers behind rising mortgage rates.

Mortgage rates have risen from 3% in January to 6% in June. On the same $300,000 mortgage, the monthly payment has risen from $1265 in December to $1800 today, according to NAR.

According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 5.23% in May, up from 4.98% in April. The average commitment rate across all of 2021 was 2.96%.

The mortgage rate is projected to land at 5.3% by 4Q 2022, according to NAR. That is still low compared to an all-time average of about 8% in the U.S.

Long term, the hope is higher rates will lead to more days on the market (gives buyers more choices). Higher rates will eventually lead to a moderation of the growth rate of pricing. With the growth rate of pricing cooling, total inventory could grow later. Historically, inventory expands six months after rates rise, but today's market is unlike any other.

Miami home prices haven't begun to moderate because inventory is low. Also, one of the supports for home prices is rents and rents are rising strongly.

Miami-Dade County single-family home median prices increased 15% year-over-year in May 2022, increasing from $500,000 to $575,000.

New listings of Miami single-family homes decreased a negligible 0.7% to 1,813 from 1,826. New listings of condominiums decreased 3%, from 2,598 to 2,521.

Months' supply of inventory for single-family homes stayed even at 2.2 months year-over-year, which indicates a seller's market. Inventory for existing condominiums decreased 58.3% to 2.5 months, which also indicates a seller's market. A balanced market between buyers and sellers offers between six- and nine-months supply.

Total active listings at the end of May 2022 decreased 33% year-over-year, from 11,730 to 7,814.

Nationally, total housing inventory at the end of May was 1,160,000 units, an increase of 12.6% from April and a 4.1% decline from the previous year (1.21 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.2 months in April and 2.5 months in May 2021.

Every time a home is sold it impacts the economy: income generated from real estate industries (commissions, fees and moving expenses), expenditures related to home purchase (furniture and remodeling expenses), multiplier of housing related expenditures (income earned as a result of a home sale is re-circulated into the economy) and new construction (additional home sales induce added home production).

The high percentage of cash buyers reflects Miami's top position as the preeminent American real estate market for foreign buyers, who tend to purchase with all cash as well as some moving from more expensive U.S. markets who can buy more with their profits from real estate sales.

Cash sales accounted for 52.7% of all Miami existing condo sales and 30.4% of single-family transactions."

Second-Best May Sales Month in History
Miami total closed sales in May 2022 outperformed nearly every other May in history despite higher mortgage rates, lower supply, and higher sale prices.

Miami's May 2022 total home sales decreased year-over-year (3,198 in May 2022 vs. 3,536 in May 2021) but performed significantly higher than every May outside of May 2021.

Miami existing condo sales decreased 7.9% year-over-year, from 2,176 in record-breaking May 2021 to 2,005 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates. Single-family home sales decreased 12.3% year-over-year, from 1,360 in record-breaking May 2021 to 1,193 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates.

Housing is sensitive to rising mortgage rates. Nevertheless, Miami May 2022 total home sales finished 21.9% higher than May 2018 (3,198 vs. 2,622).

The May 2022 total home sales count finishes as the 10th-highest total home sales month in Miami-Dade County history. The top-10 highest total sales months have been achieved in the last two years. June 2021 remains No. 1 with 4,057 total home transactions in a single month.

Mid-Market $400K-$600K Condo Sales Jump
Miami existing condo sales priced between $400K to $600K increased 29.9% year-over-year to 426 transactions in May 2022. Miami single-family homes priced between $400K to $600K decreased 4.5% year-over-year to 447 transactions in May 2022, due to lack of inventory.

Mid-market condo sales are increasing because that's where the higher inventory is. There are 2.6 months of supply for condos priced between $400K to $600K. That's the third-highest price range in supply, following $1M plus (6.2 months of supply) and $600K to $999,999 (3.9 months).

Miami luxury condos boast an inventory of 6.2 months of supply, portending more future growth in the sector given the high demand. There are 4.8 months of supply in luxury single-family homes.

Rising Mortgage Rates Should Eventually Slow Price Growth Nationally, in Miami
Home prices are determined by supply and demand. Lower supply and higher demand create higher prices. Demand for Miami real estate is at all-time highs. Inventory for Miami single-family homes (2.2 months) and condos (2.5 months) are low.

Locally, the greater share of Miami luxury sales is also part of the reason for the large year-over-year increase in median prices.

To battle national inflation, the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised rates this year and has plans for more hikes. High inflation and the Fed's tightening policy are the main drivers behind rising mortgage rates.

According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 5.23% in May, up from 4.98% in April. The average commitment rate across all of 2021 was 2.96%.

The mortgage rate is projected to land at 5.3% by 4Q 2022, according to NAR. That is still low compared to an all-time average of about 8% in the U.S.

Long term, the hope is higher rates will lead to more days on the market (gives buyers more choices). Higher rates will eventually lead to a moderation of the growth rate of pricing. With the growth rate of pricing cooling, total inventory could grow later. Historically, inventory expands six months after rates rise, but today's market is unlike any other.

Miami home prices haven't begun to moderate because inventory is low. Also, one of the supports for home prices is rents and rents are rising strongly.

Miami-Dade County single-family home median prices increased 15% year-over-year in May 2022, increasing from $500,000 to $575,000.

Miami Real Estate Had a $359.8 Million Local Economic Impact Just in May 2022
Every time a home is sold it impacts the economy: income generated from real estate industries (commissions, fees and moving expenses), expenditures related to home purchase (furniture and remodeling expenses), multiplier of housing related expenditures (income earned as a result of a home sale is re-circulated into the economy) and new construction (additional home sales induce added home production).

The total economic impact of a typical Florida home sale is $112,500, according to NAR. Miami-Dade County sold 3,198 homes in May 2022 and had a local economic impact of $359.8 million.

Miami total dollar volume totaled $2.81 billion in May 2022. Single-family home dollar volume decreased 8.31% year-over-year, from $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion. Condo dollar volume increased 3% year-over-year, from $1.47 billion to $1.51 billion.

Miami Distressed Sales Keep Dropping, Reflecting Healthy Market
Only 1.2% of all closed residential sales in Miami were distressed last month, including REO (bank-owned properties) and short sales, lower than the 1.7% in May 2021. In 2009, distressed sales comprised 70% of Miami sales.

Total Miami distressed sales decreased 35% year-over-year in May 2022, from 60 to 39. Short sales and REOs accounted for 0.5% and 0.8% year-over-year, respectively, of total Miami sales in May 2022. Short sale transactions decreased 44.2% year-over-year while REOs decreased 11.8%.

Miami's percentage of distressed sales are on par with the national figure. Nationally, distressed sales represented less than 1% of sales in May 2022, unchanged from May 2021

Miami's Percentage of Sales Continue to Outpace the Nation, State
In Florida, closed sales of single-family homes statewide totaled 28,861, down 6.9% year-over-year, while existing condo-townhouse sales totaled 13,265 down 14.4% over 15,491 in May 2021. Closed sales may occur from 30- to 90-plus days after sales contracts are written.

Nationally, total existing-home sales transactions completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, fell 3.4% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.41 million in May. Year-over-year, sales receded 8.6% (5.92 million in May 2021).

The statewide median sales price for single-family existing homes was $420,000 up 21.8% from the previous year, according to data from Florida Realtors Research Department in partnership with local Realtor boards/associations. Last month's statewide median price for condo-townhouse units was $322,000, up 28.8% over the year-ago figure. The median is the midpoint; half the homes sold for more, half for less.

Nationally, the median existing-home price all housing types in May was $407,600, up 14.8% from May 2021 ($355,000), as prices increased in all regions. This marks 123 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.

Miami Real Estate Attracting Multiple Bids, Buyers Going Over-List Price
The median percent of original list price received for single-family homes was 100% in May 2022, up 1.3% from 98.7% last year. The median percent of original list price received for existing condominiums was 100%, up 4.4% from 95.8% last year.

Miami Cash Sales 77.6% More than National Figure in May 2022
Cash sales represented 44.4% of Miami closed sales in May 2022, compared to 38.9% in May2021. About 25% of U.S. home sales are made in cash, according to the latest NAR statistics.

Cash buyers are not deterred by rising rates.

The high percentage of cash buyers reflects Miami's top position as the preeminent American real estate market for foreign buyers, who tend to purchase with all cash as well as some moving from more expensive U.S. markets who can buy more with their profits from real estate sales.

Cash sales accounted for 52.7% of all Miami existing condo sales and 30.4% of single-family transactions."
44,"Home purchases by investors recently declined in the top 10 U.S. cities by market share — including Tampa. Even so, data shows investors still hold almost 25% of the market share, or the total sales made in the market.
Investor purchases of homes in the greater Tampa Bay region declined 13% since last summer, according to new data released by real estate brokerage Redfin.

Taylor Marr, chief deputy economist at Redfin, said this could be an indicator that the housing market is stabilizing.

“So the entire housing market is cooling down. It's reacting, sort of backing off the high levels of demand that we had throughout the pandemic,” Marr said.

Tampa is among the top 10 U.S. cities by market share that saw a dip in investor purchases during the first quarter.

Records on housing sales and purchases from 40 counties across the country were part of Redfin’s data analysis. Investors were defined as buyers with the keywords ""LLC,"" ""Inc.,"" ""Trust,"" ""Corp"" or ""Homes"" in its name, according to the report.

In Tampa, investors bought 4,214 homes between January and March. That’s down from a record number of 5,065 homes last summer but still above pre-pandemic levels.

Even so, investors have been able to hold onto a 25% market share, or the proportion of total value in a certain market. This means even while buying less homes, investors have maintained the same amount of value in Tampa’s housing market.


Marr said the pullback on investor purchases in the housing market can be explained by the jump in mortgage interest rates, impacting demand, and higher borrowing costs.

“As a result, buyers are just priced out of the market and we’re seeing demand pull back,” he said. “And investors are not immune.”

Marr said it could be good news for individual homebuyers if there’s less investor competition in Tampa’s housing market.

“They behave differently than your typical mom-and-pop landlord,” he said.

The prevalence of investors can add upward pressure to the housing and renting markets: driving up home prices, the cost of rent and the rate of evictions. It’s also common for first-time homebuyers to get outbid by cash-based offers in an investor-heavy market.

Lei Wedge, an associate professor at USF’s Muma College of Business, said that in the last year 25% of all homes sold in Tampa were paid for in cash. She said that’s a large jump when compared to another peak year in the housing market, in 2006, when 8% of Tampa homes were bought in cash.

Less investor competition may be good news for homebuyers. But Wedge said there are other factors that make it hard to be a buyer in Tampa’s housing market.

“Yeah, you have less investors. You have fewer people buying. But the problem is…it’s going to be a lot more expensive for your mortgage,” she said.

Wedge explained that it will be easier for individual buyers to find a home. But it may be harder for them to afford it.

This is especially true considering the influx of people to the greater Tampa Bay region who are willing to pay higher rent and mortgages. Wedge predicts the market will ultimately end up catering to this population.

“I think what will happen is — eventually — the city’s going to squeeze the lower-income people out of the city,” she said.

On Chelsea Street in East Tampa, Antoinette Hayes-Triplett and realtor Melisha Patel stand outside of a home that's expected to close with the Tampa Hillsborough Housing Initiative by the end of the month.
CEO Antoinette Hayes-Triplett said that’s why the Tampa Hillsborough Housing Initiative is working to create innovative housing solutions for the community.

As part of its strategic plan, which was funded $4.7 million by Hillsborough County, THHI launched a shared housing initiative.

“The market has changed the way that we have to do business,” Hayes-Triplett said. “And we’re trying to be as flexible as possible and as creative as possible to make sure that people have housing.”

The shared housing initiative plans to provide 50 three- and four-bedroom homes in the Tampa community at a subsidized rent for people emerging from homelessness.

Last year, THHI purchased and repurposed two homes. Next week, it plans to close on two more homes on Chelsea Street in East Tampa. This comes after point-in-time data published earlier this month show a 4% jump in homelessness in Hillsborough County.

Hayes-Triplett said the initiative would like to amp up efforts, but the biggest roadblock is closing on contracts amid inflated home prices and investor competition in the market.

“Right now, it takes us 60 days to close. By that time, we’ve lost out to investors that are paying: in cash, site unseen, no appraisal, no inspections,” she said. “That’s the market that we’re dealing with.”"
45,"Miami Housing Inventory Rises for First Time in 3 Years in May

The Miami Association of Realtors is reporting this week that Miami-Dade County real estate posted its 10th-highest total existing home sales month in history and its second-best May sales month ever.

""The rapid rise in mortgage rates, from an average of 3% to 6% over the past six months, is tempering Miami real estate's historic pace,"" MIAMI Chairman of the Board Fernando Arencibia Jr. said. ""Although top sales marks are still being achieved, higher rates are starting to restore balance to the market. For the first time since July 2019, Miami single-family home inventory rose year-over-year. Look for fewer bidding wars, more days on market and a cooling of the growth-rate of pricing in the months ahead.""

Second-Best May Sales Month in History

Miami total closed sales in May 2022 outperformed nearly every other May in history despite higher mortgage rates, lower supply, and higher sale prices.

Miami's May 2022 total home sales decreased year-over-year (3,198 in May 2022 vs. 3,536 in May 2021) but performed significantly higher than every May outside of May 2021.

Miami existing condo sales decreased 7.9% year-over-year, from 2,176 in record-breaking May 2021 to 2,005 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates. Single-family home sales decreased 12.3% year-over-year, from 1,360 in record-breaking May 2021 to 1,193 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates.

The May 2021 sales total surged so high because it benefited from 3% mortgage rates, higher supply (particularly in condos) and pandemic-driven demand.

Many of the homes that sold in May 2022 had their rates established in March and April when mortgage rates were at 5%. 2018 marked the last time mortgage rates were at this level.

Housing is sensitive to rising mortgage rates. Nevertheless, Miami May 2022 total home sales finished 21.9% higher than May 2018 (3,198 vs. 2,622).

The May 2022 total home sales count finishes as the 10th-highest total home sales month in Miami-Dade County history. The top-10 highest total sales months have been achieved in the last two years. June 2021 remains No. 1 with 4,057 total home transactions in a single month.

Mid-Market $400K-$600K Condo Sales Jump

Miami existing condo sales priced between $400K to $600K increased 29.9% year-over-year to 426 transactions in May 2022. Miami single-family homes priced between $400K to $600K decreased 4.5% year-over-year to 447 transactions in May 2022, due to lack of inventory.

Mid-market condo sales are increasing because that's where the higher inventory is. There are 2.6 months of supply for condos priced between $400K to $600K. That's the third-highest price range in supply, following $1M plus (6.2 months of supply) and $600K to $999,999 (3.9 months). Demand is so high that if Miami had more supply, it would have more sales.

Global buyers are also major condo buyers. With global vaccinations rising and unstable political situations around the world, South Florida is seeing an increase in foreign homebuyers.

Vaccinated foreigners were allowed to resume travel to the U.S. back in November 2021 and that is leading to more international investment in South Florida - the No. 1 destination in the U.S. for foreign buyers. Global buyers purchase in Miami because Miami is a world-class global city with better real estate prices than other similar global cities. Foreign buyers feel at home with our incredible diversity and acceptance of all cultures, along with all our amenities.

Miami Luxury Condo Sales Rise

Miami existing condo luxury ($1-million-and-up) sales rose 8.8% year-over-year in May 2022 to 322 transactions, which are in a record-high range. Miami single-family luxury transactions decreased 5.1% year-over-year to 258 sales in May 2022 because of low inventory.

Miami luxury condos boast an inventory of 6.2 months of supply, portending more future growth in the sector given the high demand. There are 4.8 months of supply in luxury single-family homes.

Homebuyers leaving tax-burdened states to purchase in Florida (no state income tax), new-to-market firms moving here, low interest rates, the appeal of property as an inflation hedge, rising wages and accrued savings in lockdowns, strong equity market performance, a reassessment of housing needs and lifestyles because of the pandemic and expansion of remote work are all factors driving South Florida real estate demand.

Rising Mortgage Rates Should Eventually Slow Price Growth Nationally, in Miami

Home prices are determined by supply and demand. Lower supply and higher demand create higher prices. Demand for Miami real estate is at all-time highs. Inventory for Miami single-family homes (2.2 months) and condos (2.5 months) are low.

Locally, the greater share of Miami luxury sales is also part of the reason for the large year-over-year increase in median prices.

To battle national inflation, the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised rates this year and has plans for more hikes. High inflation and the Fed's tightening policy are the main drivers behind rising mortgage rates.

Mortgage rates have risen from 3% in January to 6% in June. On the same $300,000 mortgage, the monthly payment has risen from $1265 in December to $1800 today, according to NAR.

According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 5.23% in May, up from 4.98% in April. The average commitment rate across all of 2021 was 2.96%.

The mortgage rate is projected to land at 5.3% by 4Q 2022, according to NAR. That is still low compared to an all-time average of about 8% in the U.S.

Long term, the hope is higher rates will lead to more days on the market (gives buyers more choices). Higher rates will eventually lead to a moderation of the growth rate of pricing. With the growth rate of pricing cooling, total inventory could grow later. Historically, inventory expands six months after rates rise, but today's market is unlike any other.

Miami home prices haven't begun to moderate because inventory is low. Also, one of the supports for home prices is rent, and rents are rising strongly.

Miami-Dade County single-family home median prices increased 15% year-over-year in May 2022, increasing from $500,000 to $575,000. Miami single-family median prices have risen for 126 consecutive months (10.5 years), the longest running-streak on record. Existing condo median prices increased 27.7% year-over-year, from $325,000 to $415,000. Condo median prices have increased in 128 of the last 132 months.

Single-Family Home Inventory Rises for the First Time Since July 2019

Inventory of single-family homes increased 0.2% year-over-year in May 2022 from 2,784 active listings last year to 2,790 last month. Condominium inventory decreased 43.8% year-over-year to 5,024 from 8,946 listings during the same period in 2021.

New listings of Miami single-family homes decreased a negligible 0.7% to 1,813 from 1,826. New listings of condominiums decreased 3%, from 2,598 to 2,521.

Months' supply of inventory for single-family homes stayed even at 2.2 months year-over-year, which indicates a seller's market. Inventory for existing condominiums decreased 58.3% to 2.5 months, which also indicates a seller's market. A balanced market between buyers and sellers offers between six- and nine-months supply.

Total active listings at the end of May 2022 decreased 33% year-over-year, from 11,730 to 7,814.

Nationally, total housing inventory at the end of May was 1,160,000 units, an increase of 12.6% from April and a 4.1% decline from the previous year (1.21 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.2 months in April and 2.5 months in May 2021.

New listings of Miami single-family homes decreased a negligible 0.7% to 1,813 from 1,826. New listings of condominiums decreased 3%, from 2,598 to 2,521.

Months' supply of inventory for single-family homes stayed even at 2.2 months year-over-year, which indicates a seller's market. Inventory for existing condominiums decreased 58.3% to 2.5 months, which also indicates a seller's market. A balanced market between buyers and sellers offers between six- and nine-months supply.

Total active listings at the end of May 2022 decreased 33% year-over-year, from 11,730 to 7,814.

Nationally, total housing inventory at the end of May was 1,160,000 units, an increase of 12.6% from April and a 4.1% decline from the previous year (1.21 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.2 months in April and 2.5 months in May 2021.

Miami Real Estate Had a $359.8 Million Local Economic Impact Just in May 2022
Every time a home is sold it impacts the economy: income generated from real estate industries (commissions, fees and moving expenses), expenditures related to home purchase (furniture and remodeling expenses), multiplier of housing related expenditures (income earned as a result of a home sale is re-circulated into the economy) and new construction (additional home sales induce added home production).

The total economic impact of a typical Florida home sale is $112,500, according to NAR. Miami-Dade County sold 3,198 homes in May 2022 and had a local economic impact of $359.8 million.

Miami total dollar volume totaled $2.81 billion in May 2022. Single-family home dollar volume decreased 8.31% year-over-year, from $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion. Condo dollar volume increased 3% year-over-year, from $1.47 billion to $1.51 billion.

Miami Distressed Sales Keep Dropping, Reflecting Healthy Market
Only 1.2% of all closed residential sales in Miami were distressed last month, including REO (bank-owned properties) and short sales, lower than the 1.7% in May 2021. In 2009, distressed sales comprised 70% of Miami sales.

Total Miami distressed sales decreased 35% year-over-year in May 2022, from 60 to 39. Short sales and REOs accounted for 0.5% and 0.8% year-over-year, respectively, of total Miami sales in May 2022. Short sale transactions decreased 44.2% year-over-year while REOs decreased 11.8%.

Miami's percentage of distressed sales are on par with the national figure. Nationally, distressed sales represented less than 1% of sales in May 2022, unchanged from May 2021

Miami's Percentage of Sales Continue to Outpace the Nation, State
In Florida, closed sales of single-family homes statewide totaled 28,861, down 6.9% year-over-year, while existing condo-townhouse sales totaled 13,265 down 14.4% over 15,491 in May 2021. Closed sales may occur from 30- to 90-plus days after sales contracts are written.

Nationally, total existing-home sales transactions completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, fell 3.4% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.41 million in May. Year-over-year, sales receded 8.6% (5.92 million in May 2021).

The statewide median sales price for single-family existing homes was $420,000 up 21.8% from the previous year, according to data from Florida Realtors Research Department in partnership with local Realtor boards/associations. Last month's statewide median price for condo-townhouse units was $322,000, up 28.8% over the year-ago figure. The median is the midpoint; half the homes sold for more, half for less.

Nationally, the median existing-home price all housing types in May was $407,600, up 14.8% from May 2021 ($355,000), as prices increased in all regions. This marks 123 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.

Miami Cash Sales 77.6% More than National Figure in May 2022
Cash sales represented 44.4% of Miami closed sales in May 2022, compared to 38.9% in May2021. About 25% of U.S. home sales are made in cash, according to the latest NAR statistics.

Cash buyers are not deterred by rising rates.

The high percentage of cash buyers reflects Miami's top position as the preeminent American real estate market for foreign buyers, who tend to purchase with all cash as well as some moving from more expensive U.S. markets who can buy more with their profits from real estate sales.

Cash sales accounted for 52.7% of all Miami existing condo sales and 30.4% of single-family transactions."
47,"Palm Beach County luxury single-family home sales increased year-over-year as more single-family home inventory arrived in May 2022, according to the MIAMI Association of Realtors (MIAMI) and the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) system.

MIAMI, June 23, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Palm Beach County luxury single-family home sales increased year-over-year as more single-family home inventory arrived in May 2022, according to the MIAMI Association of Realtors (MIAMI) and the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) system.

""As luxury single-family Palm Beach County homes rise, it's also welcome news to see more single-family homes on the market,"" JTHS-MIAMI President Brad Westover said.

Palm Beach County $1-Miliion-And-Up Luxury Home Sales Rise
Palm Beach County total closed sales in May 2022 outperformed nearly every other May in history despite higher mortgage rates, lower supply, and higher sale prices.

Palm Beach's May 2022 total home sales decreased year-over-year (2,956 in May 2022 vs. 3,777 in May 2021) but performed significantly higher than every May outside of May 2021.

Palm Beach existing condo sales decreased 24.3% year-over-year, from 1,887 in May 2021 to 1,429 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates. Single-family home sales decreased 19.2% year-over-year, from 1,890 in May 2021 to 1,527 in May 2022, due to lack of inventory and rising mortgage rates.

The May 2021 sales total surged so high because it benefited from 3% mortgage rates, higher supply (particularly in condos) and pandemic-driven demand.

Many of the homes that sold in May 2022 had their rates established in March and April when mortgage rates were at 5%. 2018 marked the last time mortgage rates were at the level.

Palm Beach single-family luxury transactions increased 6.6% year-over-year to 337 sales in May 2022. Palm Beach existing condo luxury ($1-million-and-up) sales decreased 32.1% year-over-year in May 2022 to 131 transactions.

Homebuyers leaving tax-burdened states to purchase in Florida (no state income tax), new-to-market firms moving here, low interest rates, the appeal of property as an inflation hedge, rising wages and accrued savings in lockdowns, strong equity market performance, a reassessment of housing needs and lifestyles because of the pandemic and expansion of remote work are all factors driving South Florida real estate demand.

Mid-Market $400K-$600K Condo Sales Jump
Palm Beach existing condo sales priced between $400K to $600K increased 5.8% year-over-year to 201 transactions in May 2022. Palm Beach single-family homes priced between $400K to $600K decreased 23.3% year-over-year to 415 transactions in May 2022, due to lack of inventory.

Mid-market condo sales are increasing because that's where the higher inventory is. Global buyers prefer to purchase condos. With global vaccinations rising and unstable political situations around the world, South Florida is seeing an increase in foreign homebuyers.

Vaccinated foreigners were allowed to resume travel to the U.S. back in November 2021 and that is leading to more international investment in South Florida – the No. 1 destination in the U.S. for foreign buyers. Global buyers purchase in Miami because Miami is a world-class global city with better real estate prices than other similar global cities. Foreign buyers feel at home with our incredible diversity and acceptance of all cultures, along with all our amenities.

Rising Mortgage Rates Should Eventually Slow Price Growth Nationally, in Miami
Home prices are determined by supply and demand. Lower supply and higher demand create higher prices. Demand for Palm Beach real estate is at all-time highs. Inventory for Palm Beach single-family homes (1.7 months) and condos (1.3 months) are low.

Locally, the greater share of Palm Beach luxury sales is also part of the reason for the large year-over-year increase in median prices.

To battle national inflation, the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised rates this year and has plans for more hikes. High inflation and the Fed's tightening policy are the main drivers behind rising mortgage rates.

Mortgage rates have risen from 3% in January to 6% in June. On the same $300,000 mortgage, the monthly payment has risen from $1265 in December to $1800 today, according to NAR.

According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 5.23% in May, up from 4.98% in April. The average commitment rate across all of 2021 was 2.96%.

The mortgage rate is projected to land at 5.3% by 4Q 2022, according to NAR. That is still low compared to an all-time average of about 8% in the U.S.

Long term, the hope is higher rates will lead to more days on the market (gives buyers more choices). Higher rates will eventually lead to a moderation of the growth rate of pricing. With the growth rate of pricing cooling, total inventory could grow later. Historically, inventory expands six months after rates rise, but today's market is unlike any other.

Palm Beach home prices haven't begun to moderate because inventory is low. Also, one of the supports for home prices is rents and rents are rising strongly.

Palm Beach County single-family home median prices increased 29.5% year-over-year in May 2022, increasing from $475,000 to $615,000. Existing condo median prices increased 23% year-over-year, from $250,000 to $307,500.

48,"Good luck buying a home anywhere in Ontario right now, as meteoric price gains and a historic inflation spike push housing markets in the province further out of reach.

And as bad as things are in the Greater Toronto Area in 2022, rampant speculation is not limited to urban centres. According to one housing market assessment, Peterborough is now the single most overvalued housing market in the entire country.

Moody's Analytics has ranked Peterborough, Ontario, at the top of the list for most overvalued housing markets in the company's fourth-quarter assessment of housing price valuations in Canada.

Peterborough's 107.8 per cent valuation comes after years of substantial price growth for the municipality northeast of Toronto.

Though with an average annual household income of about $70,000 and the average May 2022 selling price climbing nearly 19.8 per cent to $836,843, the city's market is firmly on the unattainable side of the scale.

According to RE/MAX Canada's analysis of the valuation, recent activity ""has first-time homebuyers priced out of the market, especially local buyers,"" adding that ""too many prospective homebuyers are still stuck waiting to achieve the dream of home ownership.""

Experts attribute Peterborough's valuation to factors like rampant investor speculation, blind bidding, and low interest rates.

Despite all the doom and gloom, home sales took a nosedive in the region in May, sales falling at an annualized rate of 34.3 per cent with a year-over-year decline of 18 per cent and a 17.7 per cent dip below the ten-year average.

Though May home prices leapt significantly in May, this downturn in demand could soon translate to decreasing value.

A spike in supply could further ease conditions, though Kate Kidd, President of the Peterborough and the Kawarthas Association of Realtors, says ""it's going to take more than a few months of stronger supply to have any meaningful impact on the market balance in the long term.""

After Peterborough, Canada's second most overvalued housing market was also found not too far from Toronto, with St. Catharines-Niagara's market valued at 106.9 per cent."
49,"A new report says rental prices in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in May saw the highest monthly jump since 2019, though they have yet to reach pre-pandemic rates.

The average monthly rental rate was $2,327 per month, up 5.7 per cent from April and 16.5 per cent year-over-year from $1,998 in May 2021, according to a report released Thursday by Bullpen Research & Consulting and TorontoRentals.com. That average includes single-family homes, condos and rental apartments.

The average monthly rental rate continues to rise as the market recovers from the pandemic-driven declines in 2020 and 2021, the report said. However, rental prices in May have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels, which saw the average rental reach $2,365 in May 2019.

The COVID declines may soon ""become a thing of the past,"" said Ben Myers, president of Bullpen Research & Consulting, in the report.

""Rent's really shot up in May; [it] caught us off guard,"" Myers told CBC Toronto on Monday.

Myers said he expects prices to continue rising, in large part due to the hike in interest rates and people deciding to stay in the rental market instead of buying.

""We're still not back to those pre-pandemic rent highs from the fall of 2019, but things are definitely trending in that direction,"" he said.

Reduced supply, increased demand creating 'rapid rise'
Myers attributes the decrease in rental-market housing supply in Toronto to the interest rate hikes and the resulting growth in average monthly rent in May, Myers said.

""With the interest rate rise and prices softening and coming down, I think a lot of people are putting off buying their first property just to see what happens in the resale housing market.""

Reduced housing supply, along with increased demand through immigration, students returning to in-person classes, workers returning to the office and recent graduates moving out of their parents homes, have all contributed to the ""rapid rise"" in rental prices, according to the report.

Toronto, which had the highest average monthly rent in May for condo and apartment rentals, saw a year-over-year increase of 19.8 per cent.

Rents 'out of control'
Alejandra Ruiz Vargas has been renting a two-bedroom apartment in East York where she has lived with her child and mother for the past 10 years. She says with the continued rise in rent, she can't imagine moving anytime soon.

""Rents are out of control, specifically right now,"" Ruiz Vargas said.

Ruiz Vargas, who is also chair of ACORN East York chapter, a group that advocates for tenants' rights, says people who are considering moving to Toronto ""need to think twice.""

""I would like to have a place, probably bigger sometimes, but it is what it is. I cannot move ... People are really struggling as it is,"" she said.

""The landlords think because they didn't charge [a] rent increase in 2021, they can do it now double ... This is the wild west."""
50,"Earlier this month, Toronto was deemed one of the worst places to buy real estate in Canada.

The designation was courtesy of MoneySense’s Where to buy Real Estate in Canada 2022 report. Created in partnership with Zoocasa, the report placed Toronto 43rd out of 45 cities in terms of value and buying conditions.

But now Zoocasa readers have had their say.

The real estate agency recently asked their community which city they would personally rate as the best place to buy real estate in Canada. Cities were pitted against each other on Zoocasa’s Instagram story, and readers voted in five knock-out rounds.

In a flip from the professional designation, readers gave Toronto the top spot. Kawartha Lakes took second place, followed by Montreal. Collingwood and London rounded out the top five, respectively.


“Toronto’s win does demonstrate the affinity Zoocasa readers have for larger cities, and is also likely in part due to its general popularity, culture, [and] multiple thriving industries,” the real estate agency said.

“The performance of other areas like Kawartha and Collingwood does showcase, however, that there is definite value to be found in smaller areas of the country with quieter lifestyles.”

Zoocasa cautioned that Torontonians make up a large portion of their Instagram following, which could also have played into the win.

The rest of the reader’s rankings also varied from the official feature.

MoneySense’s report ranked Moncton, North Bay, Quinte West, and Hastings County as the top three places in Canada to buy real estate, but only Hastings County broke the top eight when readers had their say.

Officials gave Calgary 37th place, while readers put it in seventh. Oakville moved up from 44th place to 12th, and Edmonton went from 36th to 14th.

Zoocasa said Kawartha Lakes was the “biggest overachiever” in the community vote. The municipality received the 11th place ranking from officials, but readers kept it in the running to the very end. Toronto overtook it with just 52% of the vote in the final round.

Kawartha Lakes has seen sizable growth in the last three years — at the end of 2021, the benchmark price was 88% higher than in 2018.

Readers and officials did see eye-to-eye on several cities, though. Vancouver, which took the bottom spot in the official rankings, was third from last amongst readers. Mississauga, too, remained near the bottom in both rankings."
51,"oronto rent prices have risen by 20 per cent over the last year and are now approaching where they were prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A new report by Bullpen Research & Consulting and TorontoRentals.com has found that the average rent price in the city in May was $2,474, up from $2,035 at this time last year.

It marks the first year-over-year increase in rent prices since the start of the pandemic.

Previously, rent prices declined by 11 per cent annually in May 2021 and six per cent annually in May 2020 as many people left the city in search of more space.

But this past May saw the biggest monthly increase in rent prices since 2019, pushing up prices in most markets across the country.

Across the GTA as a whole, rent prices were up 17 per cent over the last year to $2,327 per month. That, however, is still marginally below the average price in May 2019 ($2,365).

Meanwhile, supply was also down across the board. The data suggests that listings on TorontoRentals.com have fallen 22 per cent since November, including 10 per cent since the peak of the resale housing market was reached in February.

“In a quest to fight off inflation, central banks across the world are increasing interest rates, and as a consequence, in the GTA, resale house prices are softening. In the short-term that is dissuading some would-be buyers from exiting the rental market, reducing rental supply,” the report notes. “This reduced supply coupled with increased demand via immigration, more students, and recent graduates moving out of their parents homes have contributed to the rapid rise in rental rates.”

The data suggests that a one-bedroom unit in Toronto is now listed for $2,133 per month on average. That equates to a 3.3 per cent increase over the last month and a 15.7 per cent increase over the last year.


But the competition for larger two-bedroom units is more fierce, pushing the average listing price up more than five per cent over the last month and 21.5 per cent year-over-year to $3,002.

The authors of the report also cited anecdotal evidence suggesting that “bidding wars, and tenants renting homes sight unseen” are becoming more common in the marketplace.

Speaking with reporters at Queen’s Park, Premier Doug Ford said that the answer to the rising cost of rent lies in “encouraging more developers to build more rental units.” But he acknowledged that it is a tough task in an inflationary environment that has pushed up the cost of borrowing and building.

“We are going to have a very, very aggressive plan going forward but we can’t do it alone. So we have to work with the federal government and the city and I am confident that if we can standardize the process, speed up the process, supply some of the land – be it municipally or provincial and federal – we can move forward,” he said. “But make no mistake about it, there are challenges. The interest rates are going up, inflation is going up so it is going to be a challenge.”

These are the 10 most expensive rental markets in Canada according to the report:

Vancouver - $3.74 per square foot
Toronto - $3.46 per square foot
York Region - $2.85 per square foot
Mississauga - $2.53 per square foot
Ottawa - $2.53 per square foot
Montreal - $2.47 per square foot
Hamilton - $2.29 per square foot
Kitchener - $2.25 per square foot
Calgary - $2.07 per square foot
Brampton - $1.90 per square foot"
52,"Whether you're a purchaser or a renter, it's becoming next to impossible to afford a place to live in Toronto. And amid the worst inflation spike the country has witnessed in decades, your gas and grocery bills aren't the only expenses trending upward right now.

Greater Toronto Area (GTA) rents skyrocketed by 16.5 per cent year-over-year last month, leaping from $1,998 in May 2021 to $2,327 in just one year, according to the latest national rent report from Bullpen Research & Consulting and TorontoRentals.com.

It's a substantial increase in rent prices, made so much worse when you plug the last year of inflation into your math.

According to the Bank of Canada's inflation calculator, the current average rent of $2,327 is worth roughly $2,507 in 2021 dollars.

Once you've factored in inflation, that 16.5 per cent increase hits wallets more like an approximately 24.5 per cent jump.

On a month-over-month scale, rents increased by 5.7 per cent in May, representing the largest monthly spike in over three years, though still a few bucks below the May 2019 rental average of $2,365.

The highest increases in average monthly rent occurred in, you guessed it, the City of Toronto proper, where the typical rent surged by 19.8 per cent year over year in May to reach $2,438.

The Bay Street corridor was a scorching hot spot for rental prices, posting the highest averages in the GTA. Renting a typical home in the heart of the city will now cost you $2,764 per month, a 12 per cent increase over last year and a single percentage point above the highs seen in 2019.

Not too far behind was the Mississauga City Centre area, where condo and apartment rental prices saw an almost unbelievable 28 per cent jump year-over-year to $2,728 per month. Watch out Manhattan.

Experts point to rampant inflation as just one of many factors in rising prices, along with inflating interest rates, supply chain issues, and most importantly, an imbalance between the supply of housing and the fierce demand for units.

The report states that this supply drought is worsened by economic uncertainty, as ""fewer people tend to move during uncertain economic times, and more would-be first-time home buyers are deciding to stay on the sidelines and in rental housing, drying up supply."""
53,"The housing market has made headline news over the past two years, with countless buyers being priced out of the market. Not only have home prices exploded by as much as 50% in some areas, interest rates have more than doubled off their 2020 lows. This has made housing unaffordable for countless buyers, as the combination of rising prices and interest rates have made the average house payment jump by more than 30%.

This may not seem to be the right time to be looking ahead to where the housing market will be in 10 years, but the truth is that people will always need a place to live. Knowledge is power when it comes to making financial decisions, so here’s a look at what some experts say the housing market will look like in eight years.

Prices Will Be Much Higher

It’s almost a given that in spite of current high prices, houses will cost even more 10 years down the line. According to RenoFi, the cost of a single-family home in the U.S. is likely to hit $382,000 by 2030.

In the near term, even though price growth seems to be slowing, the fact remains that America still faces a shortage of available homes. While rising mortgage rates will likely reduce price growth in the near term, the scales are still tilted toward demand over supply. This imbalance is likely to last at least another year, and possibly two or three, until the combination of rising new builds, higher interest rates and slower investor interest remove some of the demand for homes. 

Especially in California

Quoting the “average” price of a home in the United States doesn’t always provide buyers with information that is relevant. Real estate pricing is always highly regional, and it really does come down to “location, location, location.” If you live in California, the so-called “average” home hasn’t seen $382,000 in decades.

RenoFi projects that by 2030, for example, San Francisco will have the highest average home value in the country, at a whopping $2,612,484. Two other California cities, San Jose and Oakland, expect to price out at $2,251,703 and $1,713,554, respectively.

Save as Much as You Can

Regardless of how high prices seem like they will be down the line, the advice for those looking to buy remains the same as it always has: Save as much as you can. The biggest burden for most homebuyers is not so much the monthly mortgage payment but coming up with enough money for a down payment.

If the average home price across America will be $382,000 by 2030, potential homebuyers should be trying to save up a 20% down payment of $76,400 over the next eight years. On a straight scale, not factoring in inflation or any investment gains, that means you’ll need to save $795.83 per month. Of course, if you live in a high-cost area you’ll have to save more, but this is a good guideline as to the amount of savings you’ll need for the average home. 

Invest Your Savings

To make your journey toward reaching your down payment target easier, the best thing to do with your savings is to invest them. If you could achieve a modest 4% annual return on your money over the next eight years, you’d only need to save about $675 per month, as opposed to $795.83. And if you could earn a 5% return on your investment, your monthly required savings would drop to about $650.

Price Gains and Inflation

Although these price gains may seem astronomical, over a period of eight years, they are more or less expected to keep pace with inflation. When viewed in that light, those price gains are not only normal but relatively modest. This is why investing your savings for a future home purchase can actually give you a substantial leg up.

With prudent investing, your savings could easily outpace the gains in inflation. This means that even though prices are going up while you’re waiting, you’re actually reducing the effective cost of your purchase by increasing the value of your investments.

Is There Still Time To Buy?

If you’re trying to flip a house or looking to move somewhere else within the next two years, you might want to hold off on buying a home for the time being. But if you’re either a long-term investor or plan to reside in one location for 10 years or more, you’re likely still in the clear if you’re looking to buy.

Although prices currently seem high, experts project they will be even higher eight years down the road. While mortgage rates have ticked up rapidly in 2022, they are still trending below long-term averages — and if they fall over the coming years, you’ll have the option to refinance at a lower rate."
54,"With new housing development in San Francisco slowed to a crawl, Mayor London Breed is looking into whether reducing affordable requirements or deferring fees might get residential building job sites up and running again.

On Friday, Breed’s office called for the reconvening of the “technical advisory committee” that is supposed to periodically revisit the city’s inclusionary affordable housing program — which requires market-rate developers to either include affordable units, pay a fee or dedicate land. The eight-person committee, which includes four mayoral and four Board of Supervisors appointees, has not met since February 2018.

Breed spokesman Jeff Cretan said that rising construction costs, high inflation and interest rates, along with a sluggish pandemic recovery “make it an absolutely appropriate time to look at our policies so we can ensure that we are building the most housing, including affordable housing, that is possible.”

Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who co-sponsored the most recent version of the city’s affordable housing mandates, said “it’s definitely time to reconvene” the committee.

The push comes as the city is seeing declines at all points in the housing production cycle. Fewer new buildings are opening. Active construction sites are way down. And applications for new projects are few and far between.

During the Planning Commission meeting on Thursday, city economist Ted Egan and Land Use Program Manager Joshua Switzky delivered a mostly grim outlook for future housing development as well as office occupancy in downtown San Francisco.

So far this year San Francisco has had 1,161 units completed, putting the city on pace to see fewer than 3,000 new homes. Compare that to 2021 when 4,649 units came online. Meanwhile, there are 4,100 units under construction, compared to the high of 10,000 units that were being built in 2016 or 2017.

The future doesn’t look much better. So far in 2022, about 800 units have been approved, with a projected 2,000 by the year’s end — or just about half of the 10-year average.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of approved units are languishing as the cost of building has outpaced revenues that can be generated through rents or sales. Rents in San Francisco are still 14% below what they were pre-pandemic, while construction costs have gone up, Egan said.

And developers still have to pay a wide range of fees, depending on the size of the project, where it is and whether the builder is taking advantage of any of the “density bonus” programs. For example, fees on a 24-unit project developer Marc Babsin has won approvals for in Diamond Heights would exact $261,000 in fees per unit, while the builder of a stalled project at 11th and Folsom would pay about $75,000 a unit.

“We have been hearing more and more that the inclusionary numbers don’t work today,” said Supervisor Ahsha Safai. “We need to reset it. It’s an impediment.”

Much of the city’s housing pipeline remains clogged. There are 14 projects comprising 2,257 units that were entitled in 2018 or 2019 and have not started construction. While progress is being made on two phased mega-projects — Treasure Island and Mission Rock — several major projects remain stalled, including a 6,000-unit expansion of Parkmerced, 12,000 units at the Shipyard and Candlestick Point, and 1,679 units at Schlage Lock. In addition, the 8,550 units expected to be generated in large projects alongside the future Central Subway are stalled.

Developer Eric Tao, on the committee looking at fees and requirements, said he is hoping for a repeat of what happened in 2010, during the Great Recession, when late Mayor Ed Lee brought together a group of developers, building trades leaders, lawmakers and advocates to figure out how to get construction started again.

In the end, the city lowered affordable housing requirements and deferred 80% of fees so developers paid when residents moved into a building, rather than when construction permits were obtained. This change jump-started several noteworthy projects, including the 655-unit Lumina project at 201 Folsom St., a condo development that also included 198 affordable units at 1400 Mission.

“What happened is we all came together and came up with some tools,” Tao said. “I think we need to do that again. It seems like it’s harder now — everything is more politicized.”

The key is to find a “sweet spot” that Tao called “maximum feasible affordability.”

“We are not saying get rid of (fees), we are just saying defer them until we can get the thing built and stabilized,” said Tao.

Thursday’s Planning Commission meeting featured a number of builders and real estate attorneys who outlined the challenges the industry faces.

Sarah Dennis-Phillips, a senior director for Tishman Speyer, said the group’s most recent building, the 392-unit Mira, which opened in 2020, wouldn’t work financially today. Tishman Speyer has an approved project at the former Creamery cafe site South of Market, but that project is not feasible.

“The costs are simply too high to generate an acceptable return,” said Dennis-Phillips, who is also on the committee looking into fees."
55,"After posting four consecutive monthly declines on rising mortgage rates and worsening affordability conditions, new home sales posted a solid gain in May as some buyers rushed into the market in advance of the Federal Reserve’s June interest rate hike.

Sales of newly built, single-family homes in May increased 10.7 per cent to a 696,000 seasonally adjusted annual rate from an upwardly revised reading in April according to newly released data by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau. New home sales are down 10.6% in 2022 on a year-to-date basis.

“Though new home sales registered a solid increase in May, we expect sales to decline in June following the Fed’s action to significantly raise interest rates in an effort to cool the economy and ease inflation,” said Jerry Konter, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and a home builder and developer from Savannah, Ga. “High construction costs and rising mortgage rates are pricing many buyers out of the market. Only 10 per cent of new homes were priced below $300,000 in May, compared to 23 per cent a year ago.”

“While sales were up in May, the 696,000 pace was 5.9 per cent lower than a year ago and new home sales on a year-to-date basis are down 10.6 per cent thus far in 2022,” said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz. “Moreover, the months’ supply measure is elevated at 7.7, but existing home inventory remains very tight and this supports demand for new construction.”

A new home sale occurs when a sales contract is signed or a deposit is accepted. The home can be in any stage of construction: not yet started, under construction or completed. In addition to adjusting for seasonal effects, the May reading of 696,000 units is the number of homes that would sell if this pace continued for the next 12 months.

New single-family home inventory remained elevated at a 7.7 months’ supply, up 42.6 per cent over last year, with 444,000 available for sale. However, only 8.3 per cent of new home inventory is completed and ready to occupy. The remaining have not started construction (25.9 per cent) or are currently under construction.

The median sales price dipped to $449,000 in May from $454,700 in April but is up 15 per cent compared to a year ago, due primarily to higher construction and development costs, including materials.

Regionally, on a year-to-date basis, new home sales fell in all four regions, down 3.8 per cent in the Northeast, 21.7 per cent in the Midwest, 12.3 per cent in the South and 2.2 per cent in the West."
56,"WASHINGTON D.C.: In May, sales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly increased, but this is expected to be temporary, as home prices continue to rise and the average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is reaching 6 percent.

A report by the Commerce Department indicated that new supplies of homes reached a 14-year high last month, but overall housing inventory remains significantly low.

""We suspect May's surprisingly strong new home sales will prove to be the last hurrah for new home sales this year,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina, as quoted by Reuters.

Last month, new home sales jumped 10.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 696,000 units, while April's sales were revised higher to 629,000 units from the previously reported 591,000 units.

Economists polled by Reuters predicted that new home sales, which account for 11.4 percent of U.S. house sales, would fall to 588,000 units.

In May, sales dropped 5.9 percent on a year-on-year basis, which peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January 2021, the highest level since the end of 2006.

According to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac, the average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to more than 5.81 percent, compared with 5.78 percent last week, which is a 13-1/2-year high.

Amidst surging inflation and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, the rate has risen more than 250 basis points since January.

In terms of inflation, although a University of Michigan survey released last week confirmed that consumer confidence dropped to a record low in June, consumers' inflation expectations moderated somewhat.

According to the University of Michigan, its final consumer sentiment index fell to 50.0 from a preliminary reading of 50.2 earlier this month, down from 55.2 in May.

Last week, rising preliminary inflation predictions and a jump in annual consumer prices led the Fed to raise its policy rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, its largest increase since 1994.

""Fed officials will breathe a sigh of relief. There is nothing in today's data to change market expectations for another 75-basis-points rate hike in July,"" noted Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York, according to Reuters."
57,"A leading indicator for housing market activity—pending home sales—unexpectedly jumped in May and reversed six straight months of declines, according to new data from the National Association of Realtors on Monday, though experts warn that higher mortgage rates will continue to weigh on demand.

KEY FACTS

Pending home sales, which measure signed contracts on previously owned and existing properties, unexpectedly rose slightly in May, up 0.7% compared to April and surprising analysts who were largely expecting a drop of up to 4%.

Home sales were strongest in the Northeast (up roughly 15%), while other regions like the Midwest and West both saw declines of 1.7% and 5%, respectively.
Pending home sales were still nearly 14% lower than they were a year ago—with year-over-year declines in all major regions as buyers have had to contend with rising mortgage rates in 2022.

The average interest rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage home loan now sits at nearly 6%, not far off from its highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis.
Though mortgage rates have been shooting up this year, they moderated somewhat in May, which helps explain the surprise increase in pending home sales: The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose as high as 5.6% in early May before closing out the month at 5.25%, according to Mortgage News Daily.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate shot up again in June, however, surging to nearly 6.3% before moderating slightly over the last week or so, to 5.85% on Monday.

CRUCIAL QUOTE:

“Despite the small gain in pending sales from the prior month, the housing market is clearly undergoing a transition,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. “Contract signings are down sizably from a year ago because of much higher mortgage rates.”

KEY BACKGROUND:

Home sales and mortgage applications have both taken a hit so far this year amid rising interest rates and looming recession fears. Other key metrics for housing market activity, such as home builder confidence and traffic of prospective buyers, have continued to decline in recent months. As the Federal Reserve continues to aggressively hike interest rates in a bid to combat inflation, home buying has become significantly more expensive, with experts predicting that demand in the housing market is set to fall.

WHAT TO WATCH FOR:

The housing market remains unbalanced with demand far outpacing supply, the National Association of Realtors noted. “Trying to balance the housing market by choking off demand via higher mortgage rates is damaging to consumers and the economy,” said Yun. Year-over-year declines in contract activity “further indicated the growing need to increase supply to tame home price growth and improve the chances of ownership for potential home buyers,” he added.
Did you know that many universities and colleges across the U.S. penalize students for receiving private scholarships, or those not offered by the school? This is called scholarship award displacement. Scholarship award displacement, sometimes called “over-award” by colleges, can impact need-based financial aid awards from a student’s school, even if the scholarship(s) do not cover all of their expenses. Many universities believe this hidden practice provides an opportunity to “redistribute aid” to other students who may need it more. Some institutions reduce institutional aid first, while others replace loans and work-study before reducing any institutional aid. According to a survey, 50% of college students who receive private scholarships or outside aid experience scholarship award displacement. This prevents students from making full use of the scholarships they have earned.
Did you know that many universities and colleges across the U.S. penalize students for receiving private scholarships?

UNSPLASH

In September 2013, the National Association of Scholarship Providers (NSPA) published a white paper on the “Impact of Award Displacement on Students and their Families: Recommendations for Colleges, Universities, Policymakers, and Scholarship Providers”. Initiatives picked up steam in December of 2017, when Justin Onwenu, Rice University President, led a national campaign, #HandsOffMyScholarship. The campaign advocated for State and Federal leaders to dismantle scholarship displacement. In 2017, Maryland became the first state in the nation to outlaw scholarship award displacement at all Maryland public universities. Former Vice President of Central Scholarship, Michele Waxman Johnson, led advocacy efforts in Maryland that helped pass SB327/HB 266.
In 2019, the YesSheCanCampaign, a 501c3 nonprofit organization that I founded, joined the fight to address scholarship award displacement. In 2019, as an undergraduate student, I experienced scholarship displacement after receiving a $25,000 scholarship from a private scholarship foundation. When I notified my university of this scholarship, my university eliminated half of my need-based scholarship, my federal work-study, and increased my federal loans. I was left to pay over $15,000 out of pocket. My university gave me two choices: either drop out of college or get a private loan. While I was experiencing this brutal practice, I learned that my friend Gabrielle also became a victim of scholarship award displacement. Our university never notified us about their private scholarship policy and how it would displace a private scholarship. My university even encouraged us to apply for private scholarships. After learning that scholarship displacement was a national issue, my organization launched a national campaign to address scholarship award displacement nationwide. I had the incredible opportunity to share my story with my local State Senator, Troy Singleton. Within a few months, he introduced a bill (S985/A3789) to outlaw scholarship award displacement at all public universities in New Jersey. On September 24, 2021, Governor Murphy signed the legislation into law, making New Jersey the second state to outlaw scholarship award displacement.
But, the climb does not stop here.
In 2019, I had the incredible opportunity to share my story with Congressman Andy Kim (D-NJ) in Washington, DC. On September 27, 2021, Congressman Kim and Congressman Mike Kelly (R-PA) introduced the Helping Students Plan for College Act, the first-ever federal legislation that addresses scholarship award displacement nationwide.

In the Summer of 2021, our organization launched a free ed-tech platform called DisScholared, which helps students and families understand universities’ private scholarship policies and the practice of scholarship award displacement. Our goal is to ensure students and their families are able to make informed college and financial decisions. Through our research and experiences, we learned that some universities are not transparent about their private scholarship policies. Our website provides a database of universities’ private scholarship policies and resources to help students, families, college counselors, nonprofit organizations, and more navigate this issue.

Scholarship award displacement is finally starting to make national news. There have been many articles that provide recommendations on how to tackle this issue. Our organization truly believes that no student should be penalized for earning a private scholarship; we will continue to fight until scholarship award displacement is dismantled. It is up to us to ensure that every student has the opportunities, resources, and funding to achieve a higher education. The climb continues."
58,"You may be reading headlines and hearing talk about a potential housing bubble or a crash, but it’s important to understand that the data and expert opinions tell a different story. A recent survey from Pulsenomics asked over one hundred housing market experts and real estate economists if they believe the housing market is in a bubble. The results indicate most experts don’t think that’s the case.

As the graph shows, a strong majority (60%) said the real estate market is not currently in a bubble. In the same survey, experts give the following reasons why this isn’t like 2008:

The recent growth in home prices is because of demographics and low inventory
Credit risks are low because underwriting and lending standards are sound
If you’re concerned a crash may be coming, here’s a deep dive into those two key factors that should help ease your concerns.

1. Low Housing Inventory Is Causing Home Prices To Rise

The supply of homes available for sale needed to sustain a normal real estate market is approximately six months. Anything more than that is an overabundance and will causes prices to depreciate. Anything less than that is a shortage and will lead to continued price appreciation.

As the graph below shows, there were too many homes for sale from 2007 to 2010 (many of which were short sales and foreclosures), and that caused prices to tumble.

Inventory is nothing like the last time. Prices are rising because there’s a healthy demand for homeownership at the same time there’s a limited supply of homes for sale. Odeta Kushi, Deputy Chief Economist at First American, explains:

“The fundamentals driving house price growth in the U.S. remain intact. . . . The demand for homes continues to exceed the supply of homes for sale, which is keeping house price growth high.”

2. Mortgage Lending Standards Today Are Nothing Like the Last Time

During the housing bubble, it was much easier to get a mortgage than it is today. Here’s a graph showing the mortgage volume issued to purchasers with a credit score less than 620 during the housing boom, and the subsequent volume in the years after:

This graph helps show one element of why mortgage standards are nothing like they were the last time. Purchasers who acquired a mortgage over the last decade are much more qualified than they were in the years leading up to the crash. Realtor.com notes:

“. . . Lenders are giving mortgages only to the most qualified borrowers. These buyers are less likely to wind up in foreclosure.”

Bottom Line

A majority of experts agree we’re not in a housing bubble. That’s because home price growth is backed by strong housing market fundamentals and lending standards are much tighter today. If you have questions, connect with a local real estate professional to discuss why today’s housing market is nothing like 2008."
59,"After reporting steep drops in U.S. pending home sales over the past several months, the National Association of Realtors released a report on Monday showing an unexpected rebound in pending home sales in the month of May.

NAR said its pending home sales index climbed 0.7 percent to 99.9 in May after plunging by 4.0 percent to a revised 99.2 in April. The increase surprised economists, who had expected pending home sales to tumbled by another 3.7 percent.

A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale.

""Despite the small gain in pending sales from the prior month, the housing market is clearly undergoing a transition,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. ""Contract signings are down sizably from a year ago because of much higher mortgage rates.""

The unexpected increase in pending home sales came as pending home sales in the Northeast spiked by 15.4 percent compared to the previous month.

Pending home sales in the South also edged up by 0.2 percent, while pending home sales in the Midwest slumped by 1.7 percent and pending home sales in the West plunged by 5.0 percent.

""The largest decline in contract activity was observed in the West region, where homes are the most expensive,"" Yun said.

He added, ""This further indicates the growing need to increase supply to tame home price growth and improve the chances of ownership for potential home buyers."""
60,"In the fraught, pressure-packed, scarily unpredictable summer 2022 housing market, home sellers and buyers are compulsively tracking key real estate metrics like baseball obsessives tracking box scores—only with way more on the line than the galling perfection of the New York Yankees. Everyone is desperate to get a grip on where things are going in U.S. real estate. Are prices continuing to rise? Is inventory going to keep falling? And where on Earth are mortgage rates going to top out?

But one stat seems to sum up the current market, with all of its twists and turns, better than any other: How long is it taking for homes to sell? And in another sign of a cooldown in the housing market, U.S. homes are remaining on the market just a little longer.

While still a blistering pace, it represents a relief from the turbocharged frenzy we saw late last year and earlier this year. At the beginning of 2022, the median number of days on the market was just 21—10 days faster than it is now.

“The big trend that we’ve seen just about nationwide is that homes are not sitting for very long anywhere,” says Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. “We have relatively few homes on the market for sale, and up until recently, buyer demand has been really intense. But there have been some signs that demand is cooling.”

Why demand is truly cooling
Hale says data shows more sellers are popping up in a number of markets nationwide. She believes some of those folks held off on putting their homes on the market in 2021 because of continued uncertainty with the COVID-19 pandemic.

It might seem like a story from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. But dial the calendar back 12 months, and vaccines were just ramping up with the masses getting their first jabs last spring. Questions about the effectiveness of the vaccines lingered and it was still unclear if (and when) most of the country would be ready to open back up.

This spring, we’re now headed back to what looks like equilibrium.

“This is the first relatively normal year since the start of the pandemic. I think a lot of people were afraid they were going to miss the heart of the selling season last year and just decided to postpone their home sales,” says Hale. “They weren’t quite ready to make moves last year—and they definitely are now.”

In another hopeful sign for buyers, Hale cited data that shows the number of home sellers has increased year over year for 10 out of the past 11 weeks. More folks putting their places up for sale means more options for buyers who were weary of tiresome bidding wars.

Days on the market are starting to climb
A national median of 31 days on the market doesn’t provide buyers with a ton of breathing room. But as Hale explains, it’s a marked difference from that head-spinning 21-day median seen earlier this year. She expects the pace to slacken even more with interest rates rising.

“In the most recent week, homes sold just four days faster than they did last year,” Hale says. “They’re still selling faster than a year ago, but that gap is shrinking, and eventually I expect to see homes sell a bit slower than last year.”

More days on the market can mean buyers have more time to decide if a house is right for them and get the financing together. Buyers might not feel pressured to make a purchase they might regret down the line. Bidding wars will be less frequent and less frantic.

Be wary of using the number of days on the market to predict the future, Hale cautions.

“Days on market is a bit more of a lagging indicator than a leading indicator, so it’s not generally the first metric to change, but it is one that signals market balance.”

So where are homes still moving fast—and where are they sticking around longer?
With that caveat in mind, we took a look at the 10 markets where homes are selling the quickest and the 10 where they’re lagging a bit behind the national median.

To create our list, the data team at Realtor.com scoped out the median days on the market in May for the nation’s 250 largest metropolitan areas. To ensure geographic diversity, we limited the data to one metro area per state. Metros include the main city and surrounding towns, suburbs, and smaller urban areas.

Cities don’t tend to stay on these lists for long.

“When a housing market has homes selling extraordinarily quickly, market forces tend to bring it back into balance, either through more supply from existing-home owners selling or builders building, or through reduced demand, homeowners shifting to other, less competitive markets,” Hale explains.

That said, we did spot a couple of holdovers from last year’s look at the fastest and slowest markets, including the city that holds the crown for the fewest median days on the market. What’s in the water in New Hampshire, anyway?

Where homes are selling the fastest

1. Manchester, NH

Median list price in May 2022: $444,900
Days on the market: 8.5

The market where homes turned over the quickest is a historic city about 50 miles from Boston. A lack of housing starts might be a key component of Manchester’s rapidly moving market.

“There aren’t a lot of new-construction houses here in Manchester. We’re part of the original 13 Colonies, so a lot of our housing is dated prior to the industrial era, 1800s to 1940s,” says Suzanne Damon of the Damon Home Team at Re/Max Insight in Manchester.

“Demographic-wise, we have a large portion of millennials in our population, but we do tend to attract the baby boomers because there’s no state income tax,” she says.

Recently, Damon says she has started to see a shift.

“Interest rates started to rise in April, and that’s when we started to see a change in our market,” she says. “Last year, my offer count per listing was 12 offers versus today, it’s five and a half.”

That means the buyer—especially a first-time buyer—with a traditional mortgage or a government-backed loan like FHA, USDA, or VA, now has a fighting chance in what had been a cash-heavy market.

“Last year, 33% of my properties sold were cash. I see this [current market] as being very opportunistic for buyers who don’t have a lot of cash to come to the table,” Damon says. “These buyers who haven’t been able to buy, with a little bit of a cooldown in the market, they’re going to be able to come to the table, and we’ve seen that in the last three weeks.”

2. Raleigh, NC

Median list price: $493,558
Days on the market: 9

Not too far behind was Raleigh, with a median of nine days on the market.

Raleigh is a key part of the Research Triangle area along with the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill. Three major research universities in the area mean it’s a hub for employers on the lookout for well-educated workers.

Low inventory has been an issue in the market, says Matt Fowler, executive director of Triangle MLS. He says more area houses sold in 2021 than in any year before—and that pace has kept up this year so far.

“Think of it as a retail store. It’s not like there’s not stuff on the shelves. The shelves are full, and they’re turning so fast that it’s hard to keep them stocked,” he explains. “So there’s less inventory visible, but you can [still] find and buy a house.”

Prior to the pandemic in June 2019, the Raleigh area had 10.8 months of housing inventory to work through. Fowler says the number now sits at 3.3 months.

In an interesting twist, Fowler adds that homes priced at $250,000 or lower are staying on the market a bit longer than homes priced above $470,000. Buyers from out of state want the nicer homes and are ready to pony up the dollars it takes to win a bidding war.

“There are very publicized employment relocations that have occurred,” he says, adding that tech companies such as Apple, Google, and Meta are bringing new workers to the Triangle, with many having salaries in the $200,000 range.

3. Rochester, NY

Median list price: $224,950
Days on the market: 10 (Tie)

Tied for third at a quick 10 days on the market is this intriguing upstate New York market where buyers still must act fast. Local agents say there’s a continued shortage of homes up for sale, with one local agent reporting there are “10% as many homes as there were available in 2015” in the metro area.

The city consistently ranks high for livability and gets a ton of lake-effect snow every winter thanks to its proximity to Lake Ontario. The median list price remains friendly, which means buyers continue to make their way to this town on the rebound.

4. Denver, CO
Median list price: $695,000
Days on the market: 10 (tie)

Also at a rapid 10 median days on the market is the Mile High City. While inventory turned over rapidly in May, red flags in the area are already apparent.

The median closing price on a home fell in May, and a “day of reckoning” could be on the horizon for this potentially overvalued metro, some insiders believe.

5. Burlington, VT

Median list price: $439,250
Days on the market: 11

On the list at No. 5 is Burlington, with homes on the market for a median of 11 days. It’s not a huge shock: The city ranked second in our look at May’s hottest real estate markets.

With a median price that’s just a hair above the national median, buyers continue to flock to this town near the Canadian border. The hurdle is the same as we have seen in Manchester, NH: There just aren’t enough homes on the market right now. When a desirable home pops up, it flies off the market in a hurry.

Rounding out the top 10 are Columbus, OH, at 14; Nashville, TN, and Columbia, MO, tied at 14.5 days; and Portland, ME, and Worcester, MA, tied at 15 days.

Where homes take the longest to sell.

1. Houma, LA

Median list price: $284,500
Days on the market: 58.5

Houma tops the list for the slowest market. Even so, the number is down significantly from the median 79 days on the market in April of last year. Local agents have seen the sign of market strengthening.

“Right now anything from $130,000 to $140,000 to the $200,000 range priced right and is a nice house, those things are like war. You’re going to expect a multiple-offer situation on that,” explains Lisa Thibodaux with Latter & Blum Canal & Main Realty in Thibodaux, LA, which is next to Houma.

Many of those lower-priced residences are being bought for students attending nearby Nicholls State University.

“We have a lot of families looking for housing for students versus them renting. With the high price of rent, they’ll purchase a little house no higher than $200,000 for their kids to come to school,” she says. “Then they turn it around and put it back on the market. I’ve done many of those where, after the child is out of school, they give it back to me to put on the market.”

Thibodaux says both the pandemic and Mother Nature have contributed to the out-of-whack market around Houma.

Hurricane Ida hit the area with 150 mph winds in August 2021, damaging or destroying many homes. Many of those homes were in a flood zone and cannot be easily rebuilt or insured.

Owners “are definitely trying to get out of the flood zone right now,” she says.

2. Utica, NY
Median list price: $182,400
Days on the market: 55

This spring, homes in Utica were selling at close to the asking price. Seller supply was almost even with buyer demand, which means buyers have a bit more leeway in this upstate burg.

Foreign refugees have flocked to the unlikely locale of Utica with the help of The Center, an organization that helps people resettle from countries around the world. A recent New York Times article looked at how those refugees were helping to transform this “dying Rust Belt town.”

3. Iowa City, IA

Median list price: $319,900
Days on the market: 51.5

Need time to pick the home of your dreams? Head to this college town where the pace is more leisurely. Homes in the land of the Iowa Hawkeyes average nearly two months on the market. Still a friendly market in terms of both price and availability, demand and supply are fairly evenly matched.

Right now, there are nearly 500 homes on the market in the town—and over 300 of those are priced below $400,000.

4. Charleston, WV
Median list price: $151,200
Days on the market: 50

In this capital city, it’s still possible to score a home with a five-digit price tag. The median sale price in Charleston was $94,000 in April 2022. It’s no wonder West Virginia recently topped our list of the most affordable states for homebuyers.

The state’s most populous town sits right along the Kanawha River and has over 400 homes for sale. Just over 150 of those homes have an asking price below $100,000.

5. Salisbury, MD
Median list price: $499,900
Days on the market: 49.5

In 2021, we named it the best college town for families to buy a home. Salisbury University is the city and has a 200-acre campus and more than 8,000 students.

With nearly 500 homes currently on the market and no homes priced over a million bucks, buyers have plenty of places to choose from—and plenty of time to make a decision."
61,"""Ah Redfin,"" Glenn Kelman wrote in an all-staff e-mail two weeks ago, ""I'm sorry to say that we're asking about 8% of our employees to leave...""

The online real estate brokerage's CEO went on to announce a sweeping layoff. It was either that or cease to exist...

Redfin (RDFN) stock is down more than 90% since February 2021. And last month, demand came in at 17% less than the brokerage expected.

It's a brutal time in real estate. Last year's manic market has cooled in a matter of months. Mortgage rates have soared, crushing demand.

It might feel like another housing crash is on the horizon. That's what we saw last time around... And it fueled the worst recession of our lifetimes.

Today is different, though. And if you're betting on home prices plummeting soon, you may be stuck waiting.

Let me explain...

Mortgage rates have nearly doubled this year alone. They're nearing a 14-year high. And the Housing Affordability Index explains what that means for the average homebuyer.

This index looks at three ingredients... wages, home prices, and interest rates. These factors determine if folks can afford a house payment or not.

When this index is at 100, a typical American can afford a typical U.S. home. And when it's at 150, they can afford 150% of a home.

The index was more than 150 in the strong boom we saw last year. Today, it's at about 109. That's the lowest reading since 2008.

In other words, we're in a historically tough time to afford a home. And that environment is hurting demand.

New builds are slowing down as a result. The U.S. Census Bureau records the total number of groundbreakings for new homes. As you can see, new housing starts fell more than 14% last month...



May's shortfall undershot expert projections by about 8%.

So affordability is low, and new builds are falling. This may feel like bad news for the housing market. But it doesn't mean home prices will crater...

In fact, the median existing home price reached $407,600 in May – a record high. That's because falling home construction is actually a tailwind for real estate assets.

Take last month's dip in housing starts. It's part of a bigger story: The U.S. just doesn't have enough housing.

The number of homes for sale over the last 20 years bears that out...



U.S. housing is near record scarcity. The National Association of Realtors put numbers to the shortfall last year. It wrote that we need between 5.5 million and 6.8 million units to close the gap.

This shortage will take more than a few months of falling demand to go away. It's a multiyear problem. And it's a backstop to real estate prices.

Instead of a crash, what we may see instead is a dip in how fast home prices are rising...

Home prices soared 20.6% in the year ending this March. And they gained 13.2% the year before that. It has been a furious two-year bull run... But it's also completely unsustainable.

Home prices don't usually grow by double digits. Before 2020, home prices rose less than 4% per year. And a reversion to the typical rate is much likelier than an all-out nosedive.

Of course, something unforeseeable could change the picture. But if you're waiting for a crash to buy a house, there's a good chance you'll be waiting forever... And all the while, home prices will tick upward.

The future may hold surging rates and cooling demand. But until the inventory gap closes, a crash is unlikely."
62,"The housing market has made headline news over the past two years, with countless buyers being priced out of the market. Not only have home prices exploded by as much as 50% in some areas, interest rates have more than doubled off their 2020 lows. This has made housing unaffordable for countless buyers, as the combination of rising prices and interest rates have made the average house payment jump by more than 30%.

This may not seem to be the right time to be looking ahead to where the housing market will be in 10 years, but the truth is that people will always need a place to live. Knowledge is power when it comes to making financial decisions, so here’s a look at what some experts say the housing market will look like in eight years.

Prices Will Be Much Higher

It’s almost a given that in spite of current high prices, houses will cost even more 10 years down the line. According to RenoFi, the cost of a single-family home in the U.S. is likely to hit $382,000 by 2030.

In the near term, even though price growth seems to be slowing, the fact remains that America still faces a shortage of available homes. While rising mortgage rates will likely reduce price growth in the near term, the scales are still tilted toward demand over supply. This imbalance is likely to last at least another year, and possibly two or three, until the combination of rising new builds, higher interest rates and slower investor interest remove some of the demand for homes. 

Especially in California

Quoting the “average” price of a home in the United States doesn’t always provide buyers with information that is relevant. Real estate pricing is always highly regional, and it really does come down to “location, location, location.” If you live in California, the so-called “average” home hasn’t seen $382,000 in decades.

RenoFi projects that by 2030, for example, San Francisco will have the highest average home value in the country, at a whopping $2,612,484. Two other California cities, San Jose and Oakland, expect to price out at $2,251,703 and $1,713,554, respectively.

Save as Much as You Can

Regardless of how high prices seem like they will be down the line, the advice for those looking to buy remains the same as it always has: Save as much as you can. The biggest burden for most homebuyers is not so much the monthly mortgage payment but coming up with enough money for a down payment.

If the average home price across America will be $382,000 by 2030, potential homebuyers should be trying to save up a 20% down payment of $76,400 over the next eight years. On a straight scale, not factoring in inflation or any investment gains, that means you’ll need to save $795.83 per month. Of course, if you live in a high-cost area you’ll have to save more, but this is a good guideline as to the amount of savings you’ll need for the average home. 

Invest Your Savings

To make your journey toward reaching your down payment target easier, the best thing to do with your savings is to invest them. If you could achieve a modest 4% annual return on your money over the next eight years, you’d only need to save about $675 per month, as opposed to $795.83. And if you could earn a 5% return on your investment, your monthly required savings would drop to about $650.

Price Gains and Inflation

Although these price gains may seem astronomical, over a period of eight years, they are more or less expected to keep pace with inflation. When viewed in that light, those price gains are not only normal but relatively modest. This is why investing your savings for a future home purchase can actually give you a substantial leg up.

With prudent investing, your savings could easily outpace the gains in inflation. This means that even though prices are going up while you’re waiting, you’re actually reducing the effective cost of your purchase by increasing the value of your investments.

Is There Still Time To Buy?
If you’re trying to flip a house or looking to move somewhere else within the next two years, you might want to hold off on buying a home for the time being. But if you’re either a long-term investor or plan to reside in one location for 10 years or more, you’re likely still in the clear if you’re looking to buy.

Although prices currently seem high, experts project they will be even higher eight years down the road. While mortgage rates have ticked up rapidly in 2022, they are still trending below long-term averages — and if they fall over the coming years, you’ll have the option to refinance at a lower rate."
63,"Over half of Canadians intending to renovate their home are still pushing ahead with those plans despite the country’s economic challenges, according to a new survey – although that figure has fallen significantly from about 75% in March.

Home reno network HomeStars found that 53.6% of respondents to its latest poll had not been deterred by surging inflation and interest rate hikes in recent months, even if the declining numbers since the spring suggest growing hesitancy around non-essential spending by Canadian households, according to the company’s CEO Shir Magen (pictured top).

“Given what’s happening in the public markets with housing and cost inflation, it makes sense that homeowners are holding back on discretionary spend,” Magen told Canadian Mortgage Professional.

“There are many renovations that homeowners need to do regardless that are not discretionary and are absolutely needed. It makes sense to us that still a large majority of Canadians are going to continue to do those renovations.”

Another striking finding from the report is that homeowners planning to upgrade their living spaces inside the next 12 months estimate they’ll be spending more than $25,000 on average. That’s nearly double the figure over the previous year, and reflects the likelihood that a majority of renovations still moving ahead are big projects, according to Magen.

“I think that shows that the renovations that are going to continue are going to be… to create additional space, or to redo a kitchen for a growing family, which drives up the average project cost,” she said.

It’s perhaps no surprise that a greater number of Canadians than ever have been investing their own money into improving their homes over the past year, with public health measures, travel restrictions and workplace closures meaning huge swathes of the population are spending far more time at home than before.

As well as bringing about a housing boom, the pandemic also helped convince many Canadians of the merit of aging in place, Magen said, leading to a corresponding increase in home refurbishments over the past two years. “Not only did that create less housing supply on the market, but it also created more need for renovations,” she said.

While Canada’s housing market went on a tear during the pandemic, recent interest rate hikes have seen a marked cooldown in homebuying activity, with the Bank of Canada all but certain to introduce another oversized increase to its trendsetting rate in mid-July.

Home sales across the country fell by 22% in May over the same time last year, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), also posting a 9% monthly decline from April.

The vast majority of Canadian homeowners now appear content to stay put and invest in renovating their property instead of taking the plunge into the housing market: while HomeStars’ March survey saw 56% of homeowners indicate plans to remain in place and renovate, 84% in June said they had no plans to move.

COVID-19 public health measures have largely eased across Canada in 2022, apart from a brief period at the beginning of the year when the Omicron virus ran rampant. Still, a higher percentage of surveyed homeowners cited pandemic-related restrictions as a reason for their decision to renovate than in 2021, according to HomeStars – 40% in 2022 compared with 32% last year.

However, inflation and supply chain snarls also appear to have played their part in bringing about a change of heart among Canadians who were initially planning to renovate: 41% of homeowners say they postponed renovation plans this year because of ballooning costs of building material, an increase from 35% in 2021.

It’s important that Canadian homeowners look up cost data before moving ahead with plans to renovate, according to Magen. “There are a lot of home renovations that actually add value to the home,” she said. “Kitchen, bathroom or basement renovations are typically ROI [return on investment] positive renovations, which means that they’ll get the money they put into the reno back at the time of sale.

“If they’re able to execute these projects in a financially sound way, even though they’re going to be staying put in their home for another two to three years, they’ll recognize that investment back in home prices when they sell – and that’s a really important thing that we want Canadians to understand.”"
64,"Manhattan’s hot real estate market is starting to cool. 

As sales boomed from late 2020 through early 2022, potential buyers didn’t want to miss out on the chance to get in before prices rose further. But now, some buyers are putting their hunt on hold, according to interviews with agents and other real estate experts. Other consumers who are continuing to look are starting to become pickier about price, a marked shift from last year. 
After more than a year of frenzied sales that moved quickly and often above asking price, “there’s no more fear of missing out,” said Kimberly Jay, an Upper East Side-based Compass Inc. agent.

While Manhattan sales typically slow during the summer, market veterans believe they’re seeing more than just a normal seasonal shift. At best, it might be a return to market dynamics before Covid-19 hit, when well-priced homes sold quickly and especially desirable ones went for above their asking price while others languished for months or even years.

Across the US, the housing market has started to show signs of softening from its once-frenzied pace due in part to the near doubling of rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage since the start of the year. But in Manhattan, roughly half of purchases are in cash, meaning it’s the losses across the stock and other assets such as cryptocurrencies that are starting to chill the housing market’s momentum, agents say. The chorus of executives warning about a potential recession hasn’t helped either."
65,"Rent stabilization update

On 21 June 2022, the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) approved, on a 5–4 vote, to allow rent increases on one- and two-year leases for stabilized apartments of 3.25% and 5%, respectively. There are approximately 1 million rent-stabilized apartment units in NYC, accounting for some 44% and 28% of the city's rental units and total housing stock, respectively. The RGB is composed of nine members appointed by the mayor—two of them represent tenants, two represent landlords, and the remaining five represent the general public. Not surprisingly, the increases were met with unhappiness from both tenants and landlords. Tenant advocacy groups broadly decried the increases as an undue burden on an already financially stressed tenancy, while landlords complained that the increases were insufficient to offset the rising cost of maintenance and repairs, particularly in light of the multiple years of de minimis increases. As Robert Ehrlich, an owner's representative on the RGB, said in a 21 June 2022 Bisnow New York City article, ""The cost of housing continues to go up, elected officials do little to nothing to stop it, and this board is tasked with making an impossible decision.""


421-a update

One of the reasons housing is so expensive in NYC is the dearth of available rentals, particularly in the affordable category. In light of the 15 June 2022 expiration of the 421-a property tax exemption program, the ongoing shortage of new construction in NYC is likely to persist. The most recent version of the 421-a program, also known as Affordable New York, provides multifamily developers up to a 35-year property tax exemption in exchange for a certain percentage of the units being considered ""affordable."" According to a February 2022 study published by the NYU Furman Center, approximately 70% of apartment construction between 2010 and 2020 utilized the 421-a exemption, with the median-sized property containing 10 units.


There has been significant debate as to the value of the 421-a program. Proponents argue that development would be cost-prohibitive without the tax exemptions, while opponents view it as a giveaway to landlords who have supposedly gamed the definition of ""affordable"" in their favor and simultaneously depriving the city of tax revenue. According to a study from the New York City Independent Budget Office, between 2023 and 2056, when the last exemptions for buildings that utilized 421-a expire, NYC will lose out on USD 25.7 billion in taxes as a result of buildings that were constructed/started under the current version of 421-a.


As with any program that involves tax exemptions, it is certainly possible that the spirit of the program was not always perfectly adhered to. That said, we believe that in the absence of the 421-a or a similar program, developers already facing stringent rent control laws, extraordinarily high land and development costs, and the overhang of potential unfavorable new legislation (discussed below) will be very cautious about committing new capital to the NYC apartment market.


Good cause eviction is tabled...for now

Albany's legislative session ended on 2 June 2022 without adoption of the Good Cause Eviction (GCE) legislation that had been proposed by State Senator Julia Salazar and Assembly Member Pamela Hunter. In place of the law, the legislature agreed to create a commission to study affordable housing. As we have written frequently in the past, we believe GCE in its proposed form is akin to de facto statewide rent control because, among other things, it would have applied to virtually every rental building in the state and limited rent increases to the greater of 3% or 1.5 times the inflation rate (CPI). In addition, landlords seeking to raise rent above those limits would be required to justify the increases in court. Further, tenants would have been guaranteed the right to lease renewal unless they had not paid their rent, violated their leases, or created a nuisance (where the burden of proof would be on the landlord).


The loss of the 421-a program, stringent existing rent control laws, and the tenant protections put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic have put significant stress on NYC landlords, many of whom are small business owners. Although we are sensitive to the high cost of living in New York and recognize that rents are a significant burden for many tenants, we do not believe limiting one’s ability to earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return on their capital is the proper solution. The biggest contributor to rapidly rising rent is economics 101—demand is significantly outstripping supply. In the absence of the ability to earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return, we believe developers and their capital will seek other alternatives.


Despite the recent failure of GCE, we believe the issue will resurface again. Senator Salazar tweeted the following on 2 June 2022 (which was picked up in a 7 June 2022 issue of Multi Housing News): ""The fight for Good Cause Eviction continues, just as it has for these past three-plus years, and it will continue until we win Good Cause Eviction protections for families across the state of New York."""
66,"There were 20 contracts signed last week for Manhattan homes priced at $4 million and up, a significant increase from the previous week and a promising sign of a more stable market, according to the weekly report from Olshan Realty released Monday.

Between June 20-26, 12 condos, five co-ops and three townhouses found buyers across Manhattan’s luxury market, for a total weekly sales volume of $154.27 million. The median asking price was $5.5 million. 

Just 12 contracts were signed the previous week, marking the slowest pace of sales since December 2020.

“The bounce back this week is encouraging, as this report has always considered a weekly total of 20+ contracts signed as the benchmark of a stable market,” Olshan Realty president Donna Olshan wrote in the report. “The housing frenzy at the start of 2021 through early May averaged 30+ contracts per week, but those flush days are likely now over due to a bearish stock market, a rise in interest rates, inflation and war.”

The week’s priciest deal was for a co-op at 1060 Fifth Avenue that had been asking $20 million after having been on and off the market since 2016 for as much as $65 million. With views of Central Park and the reservoir, the seven-bedroom home includes wood-burning fireplaces in its living room, library and formal dining room.

The second-most expensive sale was for a duplex penthouse at 360 Central Park West, also with Central Park and reservoir views, that had been asking $16.495 million. It was listed in mid-May and features a 1,065-square-foot terrace surrounding the living and dining rooms."
67,"SPRINGFIELD — Median prices rose and Illinois homes sold quicker in May 2022 than they did in May 2021, as demand remained strong and mortgage interest rates moved higher, according to data from Illinois Realtors.

Statewide home sales (including single-family homes and condominiums) in May 2022 totaled 16,194 homes sold, down 10.1 percent from 18,016 in May 2021. The average Illinois home sold in 24 days in May 2022, compared to 33 days a year ago.

The statewide median price went up 6.2 percent to $276,000 in May 2022 compared to May 2021. The median is a typical market price where half the homes sold for more and half sold for less.

The number of homes for sale statewide was 21,718 in May 2022 compared to 28,717 in May 2021, an inventory decline of 24.4 percent.

“This is a very good time to sell your home,” said Ezekiel “Zeke” Morris, president of Illinois Realtors and designated managing broker of EXIT Strategy Realty/EMA Management in Chicago. “The average Illinois home spent a little than three weeks on the market during May, and some properties are drawing multiple offers from prospective buyers.”

According to the data, home sales in the Kankakee MSA (Kankakee County) totaled 119 sales, a 17.8 percent increase while the median price increased 27.3 percent to $210,000. In the Carbondale-Marion MSA (Jackson and Williamson counties) home sales totaled 148, a 3.5 percent increase. The median price increased 23.4 percent to $146,500.

“Prices increased again while the number of sales remains low throughout Illinois,” said Dr. Daniel McMillen, head of the Stuart Handler Department of Real Estate (SHDRE) at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Business Administration. “The SHDRE forecast now indicates an increase in the number of sales over the next three months. Foreclosures are down significantly since the same time last year. Inflation continues to be a concern for consumers, particularly among higher-income household, and interest rates are expected to rise this summer.”

In the Chicago Metro Area, the median home sale price in May 2022 was $327,000, an increase of 5.5 percent from $310,000 in May 2021.

Last month, 11,641 homes (single-family and condominiums) were sold in the nine-county Chicago Metro Area, a 10.6 percent decrease from the 13,016 homes sold in May 2021.

The median price of a home in the city of Chicago in May 2022 was $352,500, a 0.7 percent increase from May 2021, when it was $350,000.

In Chicago, home sales (single-family and condominiums) in May 2022 totaled 3,299 homes sold, down 4.5 percent from May 2021 sales of 3,453 homes.

Sales and price information are generated by Multiple Listing Service closed sales reported by 22 participating Illinois Realtors local boards and associations including Midwest Real Estate Data LLC data as of June 7 for the period May 1 through May 31. The Chicago Metro Area, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, includes the counties of Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will.

Based on the Freddie Mac data, the monthly average commitment rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 5.23 percent in May 2022, up from the previous month of 4.98 percent. The average was 2.96 percent in May 2021.

68,"According to a new data from RentCafe, a large influx of newcomers seeking warm weather and looser restrictions during the pandemic, alongside a wave of remote workers, has turned Florida into the most sought-after region by renters in 2022.

Miami-Dade County is now the hottest rental market in the nation, as the demand for apartments in Southern Florida is stronger than ever, putting apartment seekers in a tight spot to find a new place to call home due to high occupancy, low supply, and record-high lease renewal rates.

To rank the hottest rental markets, RentCafe analyzed the 100 largest markets in the U.S. where data was available, analyzing five revealing metrics when it comes to competitivity:

How many days rentals were vacant
What percentage of apartments were occupied
How many prospective renters competed for apartments
What percentage of renters renewed their le

New data found that South and Central Florida are the most in-demand markets, alongside certain small and mid-sized markets in the Northeastern region. While some renters are moving from one area to another —while pushing demand— others are choosing to stay put rather than go through the ordeal of hunting for an apartment, which makes the competition for the existing stock of vacant apartments even more fierce.

On a national level, U.S. apartments that became vacant were filled within 35 days on average in the first part of 2022, with 14 renters competing for one apartment to secure a lease. More so, 95.5% of rentals were occupied during the same time period, especially as almost two-thirds of renters opted to renew their leases rather than move into a new apartment or become homeowners. In addition to the number of newly opened apartments accounting for just 0.7% of the total housing supply, finding a new rental is becoming more difficult.

Florida remains the nation's most competitive region when it comes to renting, with three metros occupying the top five spots in RentCafe’s ranking.

As the migration trend toward Florida was popularized during and after the pandemic, Miami-Dade County emerged as the hottest renter hub at the start of the 2022 rental season. South Florida’s appeal to renters from New York and other places relies heavily on the growing number of tech and finance businesses.

In addition, more and more house hunters are starting to feel the strain of surging inflation and mortgage rates. As a result, they are delaying or completely giving up on their dream to become homeowners, which puts even more pressure on the apartment market. Additionally, those choosing to settle here from outside of the Miami-Dade area are facing a double challenge: an overheating for-sale housing market and an ultra-competitive rental landscape.

According to Yardi Matrix data, the number of apartments in Miami-Dade County grew by 1.8% between January and April. That’s the highest growth in new rentals among the top 20 cities in our ranking — but still not enough to accommodate the soaring demand in the Magic City, especially since three-quarters of the apartment dwellers decided to renew their leases during the first four months of the year. With almost all apartments occupied, a whopping 31 renters competed for a vacant unit, and it only took 27 days on average for a rental to be occupied.

Orlando apartments are also in high demand with renters, claiming the third place in the ranking, and is far from meeting the growing demand for housing, despite an increase of 1.5% in the total number of apartments compared to the end of 2021. As a result, only a quarter of the renters decided to move into a new apartment. With 3% of the rentals available, it took an average of 30 days for an apartment to be filled, with as many as 22 renters competing to secure a lease for that place.

Southwest Florida is the fourth most competitive rental market in the U.S. This corner of Florida is home to many welcoming cities, including Fort Myers, Sarasota, Cape Coral, Bradenton, Port Charlotte and Venice, all of which are great renting spots for people of all ages. Many of these locations have seen some of the highest shares of inbound migration in the past year, according to the latest Census population estimates.

With very few apartments opened between January and April, Southwest Florida is still not ready to accommodate this influx of renters. To make things even more challenging for apartment seekers, 72% of Southwest Florida renters stayed put in the first part of the year. The average vacant unit in the area was filled in just 30 days, and no less than 20 renters competed for an apartment in the Southwestern region."
69,"Real estate platform Redfin reports the price for a home in Miami is up over 27 percent from last year. The median sales price for a home in May 2022 was $530,000.

And it’s not just home prices that are accelerating. Homes are selling at a faster clip than they did a year ago. Miami homes sold on average after 43 days on the market compared to 62 days on the market in 2021.

Neighborhoods in and around Miami have experienced price hikes as well. For example, here are four popular neighborhoods with their median home sale prices:

Wynwood, $680,000
Brickell, $715,000
Edgewater, $780,000
Coconut Grove, $2,025,000
How have rising interest rates impacted the Miami homebuying market?

Despite interest rates going up over the last few months, this has not led to a significant decline in Miami home prices. Where we have seen an impact, however, is in the number of homes sold in the last month.

The Miami Association of Realtors reports total homes sales decreased by about 10 percent in the month of May. There were 3,198 completed sales for a total dollar volume of $2.8 billion.

So, what is fueling Miami’s hot housing market?

Experts say one reason behind the continued inflated Miami home prices is the large number of out-of-town buyers flocking to the area. More homebuyers are willing to relocate in search of an affordable home. This is particularly true for remote workers who have the flexibility to live and work from wherever they want.

Miami’s white sand beaches and warm weather are an attractive draw for relocating homebuyers. According to a recent report from Redfin, Miami is the most popular destination in the U.S. for migrating homebuyers.

Redfin measures migration popularity by counting net inflow, which is a comparison of the number of people looking to move into a region versus those looking to leave. Since the first of the year, Miami has ranked number one for in-bound migration. Tampa ranks number two, just recently surpassing Phoenix.

Not surprisingly, many of the people moving to Miami are coming from areas where housing is even more expensive. To these newcomers, Miami’s home prices seem low in comparison. People are moving primarily from pricey New York City and other regions of the Northeast.

Redfin says investors are also buying up Miami properties. Some of these are deep-pocketed corporations that will then renovate and rent out the properties.

This type of marketplace activity makes it difficult for local homebuyers to compete for the limited inventory of homes available. This impacts renters as well, many of whom simply cannot afford the high prices charged by corporate property owners."
70,"As mortgage rates rise in concert with The Fed’s rate hikes this month, fears about the American housing market pricing out tens of millions of would-be homebuyers continue to fester.

The interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage is hovering around 6%.

And not only is it becoming more expensive to borrow money, but most real estate investors and builders have said they don’t anticipate housing prices will drop significantly but will instead grow at a slower rate.

There are signs this week, however, that the real estate market is shifting ever so slightly toward the buyer. May data shows home builders have started lowering prices for newly built homes as demand has cooled.

Home sales in May were down 8.6% year over year, according to the National Association of Realtors. It’s the fourth-straight month of declining activity. May also saw the median home price break $400,000 for the first time in history.

“We’re not going to see distressed sales, but we could see a decline in prices if the economy is hurt so bad that buyers just can’t afford the high prices that sellers want,” Redfin’s chief economist said this week in response to the release of housing data from May.

71,"There is no greater joy than the one you get when buying your first home. It is an amazing feeling to call yourself a homeowner, especially when buying a property in your desired location. 

However, the recent conditions of the real estate market do make it more challenging for people to buy a house or property. The economy is still recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a lack of affordable housing in the US. Besides, people’s choice of where they want to live is gradually changing. Busy urban areas are no longer the most desired property options. Suburban spaces are growing in popularity, which is why house prices in those areas are also going up. freal

 

Buying a house has always been a difficult feat to achieve, and in recent times, it just got harder. So, you need to think and plan very carefully before investing in your first house. To help you get a better idea of how you can manage all that, here are five things you should consider before buying your first home.

#1 Study Market Trends
Understanding the real estate market trends is the first thing you should do before investing in a house. As a first-time buyer, it is natural not to know what is going on in the market. However, going in completely blind is never a good idea, especially in an economy that is not doing too well for itself. 

Research the area you want to buy your house in, and check out all the listings available there. List all the amenities and facilities you can avail of if you buy a house in that area. Afterward, thoroughly compare the prices of all the listings you have seen. 

Then, compare those prices with house prices in other areas. As we talked about at the start, people are slowly growing fond of living in suburban areas. So, you will notice that house prices in those areas, while not that steep, are still high compared to their prices ten or five years ago. 

You can talk to a real estate agent to get a more in-depth understanding of the market. Realtors can also provide you with real estate market information for specific areas, which is something you need. 

#2 Get Homeowners Insurance
Homeowners insurance will cover everything from your home and personal belongings to any injuries on the property. Not getting insurance when buying your first home is the biggest mistake you could ever make. 

On average, the cost of homeowners insurance is $1,200 per year. The cost, however, will vary depending on where your house is. Homeowners insurance costs more in states like Louisiana, Florida, Kansas and Texas. Insurance premiums are cheaper in states like Oregon, Utah and Nevada. 

Living in a disaster-prone area also increases the insurance premium. Prices also go up if your house is near the coast or far away from a fire station.

#3 Know Your Long-Term Goals
People buy houses for two reasons – they either want to live there or want to keep the property and sell it when its price increases. 

You might have to invest in renovations and add new features to your house if you want to live there. That is especially applicable if you are buying an old house. However, you would want your home to look the way you like. So, it is natural for you to renovate or add more features to your house even though its existing condition is pretty good. 

Selling your house at a later time means you have to invest in its maintenance. You might even want to renovate the whole place and sell it for a higher price right away. It would be best if you think of this as a business project rather than a personal one. After all, your ultimate goal, in this case, is to make some money off of it. 

#4 Assess Financing Options
The average house sales price in the US is over $400,000, while the median sales price is around $380,000. On the other hand, the average salary in the US is around $5000. So, to buy a house, one would have to save their whole month’s salary for 80 months or around seven years. Logically, that is impossible. Thus, it is natural to look for other financing options.

Getting a home loan is one of the most viable options you have. For a 15-year fixed term, you have to pay back the interest at 5.375% and an APR of 5.508%. Or, for a 30-year term, you can get a rate of 5.99% with an APR of 6.071%. However, you need to compare the mortgage plans across different banks that offer such loans. Only then can you settle for one that suits you and your future plans with the house.

#5 Build Your Credit Score
A good credit score is vital for getting a mortgage, a car loan, or a student loan. Without one, it becomes difficult to get approval for these loans. Besides, a bad credit score also makes it difficult to get a credit card with a low-interest rate. Borrowing money from banks also becomes more expensive when you have a poor credit score.

You can build your credit score by paying your loans on time. Another way to ensure a good credit score is by making sure that you do not get too close to your credit limit. To avoid doing that, only apply for credit that you might need, and not more than that. As long as you have a long and decent credit history like this, you can expect a good credit score. 

Buying your first house is always going to be a challenging task, especially in this economy. There are many bumps along the way, but at the end of the road is the beautiful and fulfilling experience of owning a house. So, stick to these tips as you go house hunting, and you will surely find the buying experience to be less difficult than it actually is."
72,"Home renovations can be a real chore — not to mention expensive. If it’s a change that will improve a home you plan to stay in for a long time, go ahead and take on the challenge.

But sometimes, homeowners can be fooled into thinking an update will greatly improve their home’s resale value. And that’s not always the case.

Remodeling magazine’s 2022 Cost vs. Value Report looks at how well 22 remodeling projects retain their value at resale in 150 U.S. markets. In some cases, you’ll barely recoup half the renovation cost when it comes time to sell.

The following are the home renovations with the absolute worst payoff, starting with the project in the No. 5 spot.

5. Midrange master suite addition


National average cost: $175,473

Average cost recouped: 53.4%

The study doesn’t just look at remodels, but at additions as well, meaning adding a completely new section to a house. The addition of a midrange master suite can cost more than $175,000 and recoups just over half that when the time comes to sell. But before you sell, you’d be enjoying a pretty luxe new bedroom. The Remodeling magazine estimate assumes you’ve added a walk-in closet, dressing area and bathroom with double-bowl vanity, freestanding soaker tub and a separate ceramic tile shower.

4. Upscale major kitchen remodel
National average cost: $158,015

Average cost recouped: 52.5%

If you love to cook or entertain in your kitchen, you may want to splurge on an upscale remodel — but note that it will cost more than $158,000. While you might not be doing it for resale value, you’ll certainly enjoy the perks, which include high-end appliances, custom cabinets, stone countertops and new lighting.

3. Midrange bathroom addition
National average cost: $63,986

Average cost recouped: 51.8%

One more bathroom may not recoup its costs entirely, but you’ll obviously find it helpful, especially if you have a large family or plenty of visitors. A midrange bathroom addition includes adding a 6-by-8-foot space — much smaller than an upscale version, but more practical and less pricey.

2. Upscale bathroom addition
National average cost: $114,773

Average cost recouped: 51.5%

If you can spend more than $100,000 adding a bathroom, you’re certainly living well, and maybe you won’t mind that you’ll only recoup about 50% of what you put into it. But you may never want to leave this new 100-square-foot bathroom, which includes a shower, soaker tub, two medicine cabinets, stone countertop with two sinks, heated floors and more.

1. Upscale master suite addition
National average cost: $356,945

Average cost recouped: 46.3%

Drum roll, please … the home renovation with the absolute worst payoff, according to the report, is an upscale master suite addition. But to be fair, this is a monster project, including a large sleeping area, master bath, custom bookcases, high-end gas fireplace, walk-in closet, hospitality counter with bar sink, fridge and microwave, soundproofing and in-floor heating. We’re betting those who have more than $350,000 to spend on a master suite like this aren’t going to need to recoup a lot when they go to sell.

2. Final words: Best Tips For Selling A Home With Kids

Selling a home is a tough business, as there are a lot of balls in the air between open houses, last minute viewings, and keeping your home in tip-top condition at all times. Add a child (or two or three, or more) to the mix, and you have stressed-out parents making the important financial decision to sell their home. Selling your home is a difficult process that gets even more complicated when it comes to children. It’s all too easy to become more stressed about this and realize that your house is taking longer to sell. Sure, you can successfully sell a home with children, and there are things you can do to improve your chances.

According to the 2019 National Association of Realtors® Moving With Kids study, which surveyed more than 7,000 people, school quality and proximity to schools are the top characteristics parents consider when looking for a home to buy . . However, the main problem that parents say they encounter is finding a property that meets the needs of their family. In this article we tell you the best tips for selling a house with children.

The best tips for selling a house with children

clean, clean, clean

Your children may be much cleaner than other children, or they may not. Regardless, your house should be spotless when you show it to buyers. And there’s a good chance that even if your kids are relatively clean, they’ll still make doughs while playing. You must be prepared for this challenge as you move forward to show the property. Sellers trying to sell quickly will generally try to keep their homes as clean as possible at all times and will be prepared to clean immediately if a visitor approaches.

As a parent, you’ll face the added challenge of cleaning up after yourself and your little ones. When you have children, tidying up your home becomes even more critical. Children are known for leaving things in the blink of an eye. While this is usually not a big deal, when selling a home it certainly can be! See how to declutter your home for expert guidance when you’re selling.

Try to accommodate all exhibits

When agents visit homes, we typically show several in a few hours. They are usually scheduled by distance, starting somewhere and going further. If the seller declines the visit, chances are the buyers we’re dating will like something and we won’t come back to your house, not to mention we’re a long way from your house right now. Keep in mind that most shoppers are out after work so accommodating evenings and weekends is essential.

Make sure your kids are aware of the sale

One of the best tips for selling a house with children is to let them know about your plans long before the actual for sale sign is put up on the lawn. Parents have a clear desire to protect their children from turmoil or conflict. It can be tempting to avoid discussing selling the house with your children.

You may be worried that the idea of ​​moving will scare her or cause arguments. You may not want to interrupt her routine more than necessary. Whatever your reasons for not wanting to say something, know that in the end, your family will be better off if you have open communication about this big decision.

Remember, your kids are likely just as excited about the sale and the upcoming new house as they are upset or worried. Much of their perception of the upcoming event will be based on what you say and how you say it.

If you explain why you want to sell the house and what you want to achieve, such as moving to a better house, a better neighborhood, being with the people you love, etc., they are more likely to understand and agree. enthuse. with you.

Clear communication will also allow you to seek their help in meeting the challenges ahead. Keeping the rooms clean, going out for screenings, and generally being helpful are all things you’ll appreciate in the months to come.

Set expectations immediately with your agent regarding children’s sleep schedules
Most buyers visit properties after work, especially on weekdays. If you have small children who go to bed at 6:00 am, please inform your agent that no visits should be made after 5:30 am, etc. Keep in mind that you are really narrowing your window to potential buyers when you have time constraints like this. Be flexible if you can.

If you need to do screenings around bedtime, you can sit outside in your car while the screening takes place. Put your kids in their pajamas before the screening. You can also ask your tour comment agent to let you know in advance about all tours. This will help you prepare your house in plenty of time.

Make home attractive to the masses

A lot of the things you do to your house to make it more fun for your kids are things you’ll want to make more generic for sale. Stunning murals on the walls, special play areas, fun colors, family photos – these things make your life and your child’s life more enjoyable, but they won’t attract many buyers. There can be single buyers, married buyers with no kids, retirees, and all kinds of people looking at the house. Many of them may view the child-friendly features it has negatively.

Your agent will likely recommend that you return things to neutral when you prepare the house for sale. You may need to paint rooms more neutral, bring rooms back into more general areas, and remove photos of your family for display. Try not to take the changes personally. You are making a commercial transaction, which means adapting to what the market asks for so that you can sell at the best possible price.

Toys

Try to condense the number of toys your kids are playing with while your house is on the market. Compete with everyone else until you move. The bin is all they can play with while you’re selling. It’s easy to retrieve for the last minute presentation and easy to put in the garage or in your car for the presentation.

Get rid of children’s murals and other heavy decorations for children

There is a big difference between living in a house and selling it. When you live in a house, you mainly do what you want, including decorating it to YOUR liking. This often includes children’s rooms. It’s not uncommon to have what you might consider “a cool wall mural” on the wall of a child’s room. Unfortunately, these are very personal and will make your home more difficult to sell.

Having an authoritative decoration can be a stumbling block for many buyers. You might think that a buyer should be able to look beyond someone’s personal “stuff,” but that’s not always the case.

Plan what your family will do during the presentations

Let your children know that you will show the house to people who want to buy it. How often do you show up and when is it between you and your real estate agent? Know that the more flexible you are, the easier it will be for your agent to sell the house.

Once you know when show times are possible, you can plan how you’ll spend your time with your kids. There are lots of fun things you can do, and they don’t all have to be expensive. You can go to the library, visit the playground, buy groceries, or hang out with a friend or family member. Talk to your kids ahead of time about what they think will be the most fun and go from there.

74,"Pending-home sales unexpectedly rose in May, breaking a six-month streak of declines, the National Association of REALTORS® reported, citing its Pending Home Sales Index.    

Pending sales, in which the contract has been signed but the transaction has not closed, are considered a leading indicator and generally precede existing-home sales by a month or two. They rose 0.7% on a monthly basis last month and 13.6% on an annual one, according to a press release.    

Despite the monthly gain, the housing market is “clearly undergoing a transition” because of higher mortgage rates, NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said. 

Based on the median single-family home price and a 10% down payment, the average monthly mortgage payment has increased by about $800 since the beginning of the year due to increased mortgage rates, which have climbed by 2.5 percentage points during that time, NAR said.  

“Trying to balance the housing market by choking off demand via higher mortgage rates is damaging to consumers and the economy,” Yun added. “The better way to balance the market is through increased supply, which also helps the broader economy.” 

First American economist Ksenia Potapov concurred. 

“Declining affordability is weighing on homebuyers, but demographic headwinds will continue to drive demand,” she said. “The bigger problem may be the ongoing lack of housing supply. Existing homes make up approximately 90% of inventory, but existing homeowners are staying put. … Fewer existing homeowners selling means fewer homes for sale and, ultimately, fewer sales.” 

Two of the four geographic regions saw decreases in contract activity from the previous month, led by the West, with a 5% drop, and followed by the Midwest, with a 1.7% decline. Pending sales jumped 15.4% in the Northeast and inched 0.2% higher in the South.  

“The largest decline in contract activity was observed in the West region, where homes are the most expensive,” Yun said. “This further indicates the growing need to increase supply to tame home-price growth and improve the chances of ownership for potential homebuyers.”"
75,"Atlantans have to earn 39.3% more than a year ago to afford the region's median-value home, per the latest analysis by real estate company Redfin.

The big picture: The income needed to afford a home has increased as soaring demand and limited inventory continue to push sale prices up.

And increasing mortgage rates make borrowing more expensive, too.
Why it matters: Because incomes are not keeping pace with home prices, it further constricts entry into the metro Atlanta housing market for most people.

By the numbers: In March 2021, you had to earn at least $48,919 to afford the median home for sale in the Atlanta metro area, Redfin found.

Now, you need to bring in $68,140.

For a median sales price home of $368,000, a monthly mortgage, with 5% down, jumped from $1,223 to $1,703.

Of note: A monthly mortgage payment is considered affordable if the homebuyer spends no more than 30% of their income on housing.

Meanwhile, wages in Atlanta grew 3.3% over the same period, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

Median pre-tax income in Atlanta in 2021 was $50,000, per a recent Zillow study.
Zoom out: Across the U.S., buyers need 34% more income to afford a home, Redfin found."
76,"LOUDOUN COUNTY, VA — The housing market is beginning to cool in Loudoun County, according to the Dulles Area Association of Realtors' May market report. Home inventory was up in May while pending sales decreased.

Rich Blessing is the current president of the Dulles Area Association of Realtors. ""With more than a 65 percent hike in inventory this month compared to last May, we’re seeing signs that the market is beginning to level out,"" Blessing said.

In May 2022, there were 464 active listings, according to the report. It represented a 67 percent increase over May 2021's listings. May 2022 was also the third consecutive month where the number of listings has grown in Loudoun County.

""Although the market is still far from balanced, the continued gains in supply are certainly a welcome sight for those in the homebuying process,"" Blessing said in a news release. ""The market is always changing, which is why it’s absolutely imperative that both buyers and sellers turn to their knowledgeable Realtor for guidance and support.""

The number of sales in May 2022 was 17 percent lower than the number of sales in 2021. Sales activity in Loudoun County has been trending downwards for nine straight months compared to 2021's record pace.

Still, home prices continue to grow. In May 2022, the median home sale price was $699,950. It represents an 11 percent increase over May 2021's prices."
77,"A wintry summer is brewing for B.C.’s real estate market with soaring interest rates drastically reducing buyer purchasing power while sellers clamber for yesterday’s prices. Home sales fell sharply in May while home values are declining, slowly but surely.

Multiple Listing Service (MLS) sales fell 16.3 per cent in May adding to April’s 13 per cent decline to a seasonally-adjusted 6,853 units. On an unadjusted basis, sales fell 34 per cent.

While sales remained above levels observed just prior to the pandemic and above the same-month average from 2010-19, momentum is quickly weakening. This is not surprising with fixed mortgage rates well above four per cent and at a 10-year high, while variable rates are rapidly shifting higher. With home prices up 40 per cent during the pandemic, prospective buyers face a very different market, and many have quickly been priced out of ownership. High consumer price inflation is further amplifying affordability challenges for households.


Sales declines were observed in most regions of the province. Specifically, the real estate boards of Chilliwack (-25 per cent) and the Fraser Valley (-20 per cent), which covers Abbotsford-Mission and eastern communities of Metro Vancouver, including Surrey, led the drop in sales while the rest of Metro Vancouver fell 18 per cent. Vancouver Island fell 18 percent, but remained elevated, with more modest declines in the interior and northern markets. In contrast, retiree demand and migration from Alberta continues to support conditions outside Metro Vancouver.

Declining sales are contributing to a quick moderation in market conditions. Fewer sales and steady new listings lifted active listings in the province for a fifth straight month with inventory on the rise in most markets. Sales-to-active listings ratios remain in a range consistent with a sellers’ market, but the rapid decline suggests markets are nearly balanced, with the potential to move into a buyers’ market range.

At $980,324, the average price fell 4.7 per cent from April and marked the first sub-million-dollar reading since November. Consistent with sales, declines were deepest in Chilliwack (-4.3 per cent) and the Fraser Valley (-6.7 per cent), although average prices eroded in most real estate board areas.

After an impressive run where B.C. manufacturing sales increased for seven consecutive months, the streak came to an end in April as sales dipped 2.9 per cent from March to $5.8 billion. Both durable goods (down 1.6 per cent) and non-durable goods (down 4.5 per cent) posted weaker sales.

Key manufacturing areas such as wood products (down 5.9 per cent); transportation equipment (down 5.5 per cent); computer and electronic equipment (down 3.2 per cent); and electrical equipment, appliances and components (down 5.1 per cent) weighed down overall sales. The decline was only partially offset by a few sectors showing gains, such as food manufacturing (up 1.7 per cent), fabricated metal products (up 2.3 per cent) and sales of machinery (up 3.9 per cent).

Over 2022’s first four months, total sales remained 10.1 per cent of last year’s pace with durables (up 6.7 per cent) and non-durables (up 15.1 per cent), considerably ahead of last year’s pace notwithstanding April’s dip in activity. Manufacturing sales activity dipped across the province in May. In Metro Vancouver, sales fell 1.5 per cent and were down 4.3 per cent in the rest of British Columbia."
78,"Vancouver continues to have the least affordable housing in the country, RBC Economics reported on June 23.

During the first quarter, the price of the average residence in Vancouver would devour 82 per cent of median household income – the first time the index has been this high since the first quarter of 2019.

“The bad news is that it will likely worsen,” RBC chief economist Robert Hogue wrote, noting the impact of higher interest rates, which have increased six-fold since March and will likely leap again on July 13. “Any further rate hikes are poised to hit local buyers disproportionately and the outlook for the market has already shifted. Resale activity has fallen by a third this spring and we see the weakening trend persisting in the months ahead.”

A standard definition of affordable housing is anything requiring less than a third of household income.

RBC doesn’t offer any solutions to improve affordability. Rather, it says affordability will follow as wages increase and housing prices drop. It forecasts a 13 per cent drop in residential prices this year for BC.

Some say the decline has already started, with the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver reporting that the benchmark price for residential properties fell 0.3 per cent in May to $1,261,100.

According to the development sector, more homes are the way forward. By providing a greater selection of units at a greater range of price points, prospective buyers will have more options and upward price pressure will be diffused.

“Part of the essence of increasing supply is not just literally creating more single-family homes or more condos, it’s to create more supply to give citizens a better opportunity to get into housing that fits and suits their needs,” said Shane Styles, president of Epic Real Estate Solutions in Kelowna. “Some of those needs are financial, some of them are geographic. Some are family-related. … Affordability isn’t just what my rent is every month or my mortgage. It’s also how much do I have to pay in gas to get to my job, or take my kids to their activities.”

According to a report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. last week, 570,000 new homes are required in B.C. by 2030 to restore any semblance of affordability – which CMHC defines as housing requiring 44 per cent of disposable income. Currently, residents of BC require 58.3 per cent of their income to purchase a home, based on the average price of homes listed and sold through the MLS platform.

“How will supply improve affordability? More housing units created in the housing market will create opportunities for households to move into housing that responds to their demands,” CMHC stated. “In addition, this ‘filtering process’ likely frees up housing to improve housing affordability over time.”

However, CHMC also urged a separation of home ownership from the rental system “because increasing the supply of rental units will play a critical role in achieving affordability over the long term.”

But the two are linked. High home ownership costs tend to keep people renting for longer, and the high cost of housing means a greater supply of rental housing is needed. But even it’s not coming fast enough.

“Housing affordability is a rising concern for all buyers in the market, particularly given the inability of all levels of government to accelerate the construction of new rental supply,” said Michael Ferreira, principal of Zonda Urban, of the Vancouver market. “There are just 21 new purpose-built rental projects with just over 1,600 units scheduled to complete by the end of this year. This is a fraction of what’s needed to meet existing demand, let alone the new demand created by significantly higher immigration targets over the next few years.”

The result is upward pressure on rents across the market, because supply can’t keep pace with demand.

In some markets, Ferreira said, monthly rents are pushing $6 a square foot – an unprecedented level for the region."
79,"B.C. needs to increase its number of homes by roughly a quarter more than is forecast for the housing market to be affordable in 2030, according to projections by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).

Currently, British Columbians pay about 60 per cent of their disposable income on housing on average, according to a CMHC report released Thursday (June 23). The CMHC projects the total number of homes in the province will increase to 2.64 million in 2030 if existing trends do not change.

This means new construction needs to increase by at least 570,000 more units than projected in order for British Columbians to pay 44 per cent of their disposable income on housing on average. Alternatively, new construction needs to increase by at least 620,000 more units than projected for residents to pay 40 per cent of their disposable income on average.

Shane Styles, president of Epic Real Estate Solutions in the Okanagan, said it is high demand that causes unaffordability, so government recognition that a supply increase is needed is welcome.

“Canada is an incredibly desirable place to live. British Columbia — and I would not even say arguably — is the most desirable province in our glorious nation. There is a lot of demand, it is outstripping supply,” he said. “I do not believe that demand is going to go down.”

Styles sees the problem in Kelowna, which has an effectively zero per cent (0.6 per cent) vacancy rate, he said.

One point from the report stood out to Styles. CMHC’s goal is for everyone to afford a home that “meets their needs.” This language signals more choice is a priority. B.C. will need to increase the number and variety of units available to provide affordable options in renting, co-op housing, subsidized housing and home owning.

Styles said the biggest barriers to new units are at the municipal level. Communities need to accelerate the approval process for projects that fit existing plans and pave the way for denser housing. Also, when they make or revise plans, they need to leave some room to be flexible.

Meanwhile, on the national front, CMHC forecasts roughly 18.5 million homes in 2030 if existing trends do not change. To level the housing market in each province so homes cost 40 per cent of a household’s disposable income on average, this number would need to rise to almost 21 million units in 2030.

CMHC’s projections assume the number of households and their incomes will rise as interest rates fall. Interest rates are currently on the rise as the central bank tries to slow inflation. Styles said he is not concerned, because rates are still significantly lower than homebuyers experienced during the previous century.

If the supply can be increased, the renters who are priced out of the housing market will have more affordable options and will be able to make their bid for home-ownership."
80,"Some of the Greater Toronto Area’s (GTA) most exclusive luxury neighbourhoods shine brightest in the summertime, in all of their tree-lined, manicured lawn, and swimming pool-filled glory. 

From Forest Hill and Rosedale, to The Kingsway, the warmer weather makes these breezy neighbourhoods even more picture-perfect, adding to the curb appeal of their sprawling homes. 


But is the summertime the right time to list your home on the luxury market in the GTA? It can be — but there are a few important considerations to take into account.

“Summer is always a slower time for luxury real estate in the city,” says Andy Taylor, Senior Vice President of Sales at Sotheby’s International Realty Canada. “For many, this is the season to get away to the cottage. Especially after the pandemic, more and more people have cottages that they’re escaping to on the weekends, instead of staying in the city to list their home.”

A lot of the higher-end luxury inventory has been kept off the market during the summer months, says Taylor. “Instead of posting it to the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), agents are selling luxury homes as exclusives,” he says. “Although there are transactions happening in the luxury market, they’re not being captured by MLS. This summer in particular, we will continue to see transactions, but the volume of transactions will slow down.”

Sotheby’s currently has a handful of multi-million-dollar properties — including The Residences at the Ritz Carlton, 125 Cumberland, and a $10.75 million property in Rosedale — that are all exclusive listings. 

When it comes to buyer trends, Taylor says that those in the market for a luxury listing are seeking specialty properties that are finished and require little planning or work. “Homebuyers don’t want to work on renovations, especially in the summer, as they’re looking to travel or go to the cottage,” says Taylor. “Recently, there have been a lot of delays when working with contractors, so buyers aren’t able to get their finishings done as quickly as anticipated. Properties that require a lot of work are sitting, whereas homes that show exceptionally well are getting offers and are selling a decent price point.”

In addition to completed properties, the GTA’s luxury home seekers have their eyes out for amenities. “For the luxury homebuyer, they want a unique property that has already been completed and comes with high-level amenities,” says Jodi Allen, Senior Vice President of Sales at Sotheby’s International Realty Canada. “For instance, high-quality finishes, nice layouts, room for an office, a gym, and high ceilings are all on the luxury buyer’s wish list. Right now, a lot of buyers have also been asking about pools. Travel has been hectic lately and buyers are looking to stay in Toronto or travel to the cottage, so having a pool is key for the summertime staycation.”

Taylor and Allen highlight how the spring weather brought a shift in the Canadian real estate market. After a red-hot and often record-breaking run, GTA home prices finally started to soften as of late and the market has dialled back the drama.

“The media has been focusing on the slowdown of the market, which has impacted buyers as they’re taking their time to make decisions and there’s much less urgency than what was seen from March to May,” says Taylor. “Properties aren’t being offered with an offer date, instead they’re being marketed with what the agents are feeling is the true value of the property. For sellers, their expectations of price haven’t changed, whereas buyers are expecting a price decrease.”

Sellers are starting to realize that properties have to be priced properly in order to sell, according to Taylor. “If sellers are planning to test the market with a high price point, they shouldn’t bother listing,” says Taylor. “For buyers, under-pricing and holding back on an offer is also not working well, so the majority of agents are no longer taking this approach. Currently, pricing properties accurately is very important to both parties.”

Allen agrees that the biggest mistake sellers are making right now is in the price department. “Right now, you can’t play aggressive and throw a high price on a property just to test the market,” she says, driving the point home. “Instead, sellers need to price their property where it shows value.”

For those looking for a luxury Toronto property, the pickings are slim in some of the most coveted neighbourhoods.
“We’re actually seeing a lack of inventory in neighbourhoods like Rosedale, The Annex, and Yorkville, but in Lawrence Park there’s been an increase,” says Allen. “The downtown area — which mostly consists of luxury condos — had also been quiet recently, but is now just starting to pick up again. As the shock and awe of interest rate hikes begin to cool down, we should see the showings come back to reflect a traditional summer market in these key neighbourhoods.”

For those considering selling their luxury property in the summer months, Allen says that the most important thing to remember is that you don’t want the listing to go stale.

“In the summer, sometimes it’s best to keep a listing exclusive which puts pressure on the agents to work harder, make calls, and build the awareness of property,” says Allen. “We’re still not sure what the fall market will look like, so some would say that it’s best to list a home during the summer, even though it’s slower. For most of our GTA listings, we’re keeping them exclusive before putting them on MLS in September.”

Allen also advises sellers to ensure that the listing looks like a model showroom and reflects the amenities that are important in the summertime. “For example, sellers should make sure that the outside of their home is staged, the gardens have been taken care of, the barbeque has been cleaned, and the deck furniture is set up,” she says. “People tend to visit the outside of a home first before going outside, so it’s important that the exterior is a good representation of the property.”

Finally, Allen says that it’s important that the pictures of the listing reflect the season. “At Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, we make sure that all photos and videos of our listings are up-to-date, which gives the buyer a real insight into what the property currently looks like,” says Allen."
81,"The average property rental price in the Greater Toronto Area in May saw the largest single-month hike in the past three years, as potential homebuyers back away from rising interest rates, reducing rental supply, a recent report says.
The report, co-authored by Bullpen Research & Consulting and TorontoRentals.com, shows the average monthly rental rate in the GTA surged by 5.7 percent in May. Average rent also saw a 16.5 percent year-over-year increase, from $1,998 in May 2021 to $2,327 in May 2022, which is fast approaching the pre-COVID-19 level of $2,365 in May 2019.
“In a quest to fight off inflation, central banks across the world are increasing interest rates, and as a consequence, in the GTA, resale house prices are softening. In the short-term that is dissuading some would-be buyers from exiting the rental market, reducing rental supply,” the report said.
“This reduced supply coupled with increased demand via immigration, more students, and recent graduates moving out of their parents’ homes have contributed to the rapid rise in rental rates.”
However, as higher rates threaten to push the country into a recession and flatten out the resale prices, prospective buyers are eyeing to leave the rental market when the housing market hits the bottom, the report said.
Breaking it down by housing type, condo apartments led the surge in rental rate, moving from $2,106 per month in May 2021 to $2,623 per month in May 2022, which is an annual increase of 25 percent.
Single-family homes had an average monthly rental rate of $3,233 per month in May 2022, rising from $2,870 per month in May 2021, which represents an annual increase of 12 percent. Rental apartment rents saw an annual increase of 10 percent, rising from $1,898 per month in May 2021 to $2,092 per month this year.
Overall, the change in listing compositions has contributed to rents being lower in 2022 compared to 2019, with single-family homes, condo apartments, and rental apartments having higher rents in May 2022 than in May 2019, the report said.
In addition, as a growing number of super-small condos hits the market, rental rates for this size range are not increasing as quickly, with units from 700 square feet to 1,000 square feet growing at about 15 percent to 16 percent annually, the report said.
Rental rates are climbing at a slightly different pace across municipalities in the GTA.
The fastest growth was seen in the pre-amalgamated area of the City of Toronto, which saw nearly 20 percent annual growth.
The most desirable neighbourhoods prior to the pandemic are experiencing the highest rent growth in 2022, at 15 percent to 20 percent annually, whereas the less desirable communities, or what is known as “outer-416,” saw a more modest annual rent inflation at 5 percent to 10 percent, the report said.
In May, Toronto had the highest average monthly rent for condos and apartments at $2,438 a month, and it also had the highest annual rent increase of 19.8 percent. Burlington and Etobicoke followed closely with average monthly rents of $2,233 and $2,263 per month respectively. Burlington had an annual rent increase of 18.3 percent and Etobicoke at 17 percent.
Coming next in line in annual change in average monthly rent for condos and apartments were Mississauga at $2,224, up 12.9 percent; Oshawa at $1,807, up 12.4 percent; York at $2,083, up 12.2 percent; Oakville at $2,299, up 11.2 percent; North York at $2,102, up 10.2 percent; and East York at $1,898, up 8 percent.
Vaughan was the only city that saw a decline in annual average rental price change for condo and apartment rentals, with a 6.6 percent decrease to $2,072 per month."
82,"A Chronicle analysis of Redfin data finds that sales have slowed in recent months, returning closer to what has served as “normal” in past years.

One Realtor told us that houses that would’ve ordinarily drawn more than 20 offers are now getting just three. Price drops are becoming more common among listings, and homes are selling closer to their asking price.

With the prospect of a recession, potential buyers likely are growing increasingly hesitant to put down the cash for a home right now.

83,"It doesn’t matter if you’re in the market for a home right now or not — everyone’s talking about rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised its rate three-quarters of a percentage point in June, the biggest increase in nearly 30 years, and after two years of a red-hot housing market, there are signs everywhere that home buying may finally slow.

Real estate experts are starting to see Bay Area home buyers drop out of the market entirely, fewer people turn out for open houses, homes sitting on the market for more than a few weeks, and even — gasp — the return of some contingencies. Plus, rates are expected to continue climbing. 

Many of these consequences of rising interest rates, especially when coupled with high inflation, aren’t exactly surprising. What might surprise some Bay Area residents though, is the impact all of this could have on the rental market.

“​​When we look at the price of renting versus the price of a mortgage [in the Bay Area] this is the largest divide we see across the country. It’s almost three times more expensive to pay for a mortgage than to rent, so we’ll likely see rent rise as a result,” Nicole Bachaud, an economist with Zillow, said.

If a seller can’t sell their home, they may decide to rent their property while they wait for it to sell, in addition to having to rent themselves, since in the Bay Area it’s rare to live in your home while it’s on the market. Moreover, those who were in the market to buy are now back in the rental market, perhaps looking to upgrade their space since they weren’t able to buy. 

While the Bay Area may be the only place in the country where rents have not surpassed pre-pandemic levels, that’s unlikely to last in the current environment.

Bachaud said interest rate hikes are more likely to hit first-time home buyers in the region harder than they would in the rest of the country, forcing many out of the market entirely. “When you look at the typical home value in San Francisco at $1.5 million, that’s up significantly, about 30%, since before the pandemic. When you also couple the interest rate hikes with that, you’re looking at thousands of dollars more a month in a mortgage than even just a year ago,” Bachaud said. “Using that example and looking at a 3% interest rate versus a 6% interest rate, that’s more than a $2,000 difference. That’s more than most people’s mortgages across the country.” 

Redfin agent Andrea Chopp said while so many buyers have been priced out of the market, she thinks it’s actually a great time to buy — if you can afford it. “A lot of [homes] are just sitting now. There’s no competition. Where there might have been competition a few months ago, now you have interest rates, high gas prices, inflation and people have just stopped,” Chopp said. “Buyers right now have the most power they’ve had since I’ve been doing this.”

It’s still the Bay Area, though. “For the buyers still in the market, they’ll see less competition and they can take a little more time to make decisions … but it's not necessarily going to be a buyer's market because we’re still going to have homes that are still unaffordable for most folks,” Bachaud said. 

While inventory has increased across the Bay Area in recent months, rising interest rates could continue to make inventory a challenge, as those homeowners who locked in at a low rate are less likely to list their homes since they won’t be able to buy something at the same rate. “That’ll keep prices high for the foreseeable future,” Bachaud said. 

Chopp, an agent since 2015, said some of her sellers are considering renting their properties given how long it’s taking to get an offer. She said sellers have had to adjust their expectations and be prepared for a lower price than they were anticipating and even accept contingencies. “Now all of a sudden three weeks on the market and sellers are freaking out. That’s normal in the rest of the country,” Chopp said. “Contingencies were impossible before.” 

Listings with a price cut have risen to 8% up from 5% in April in San Francisco, according to recent Zillow data. “Sellers may have been a little too ambitious given the changing tides we’re seeing,” Bachaud said.

There is typically a slight summer slowdown in the housing market, but the past few weeks have been jarring. “It's like it just stopped. Buyers have completely disappeared,” Chopp said. “Since I've been doing this, it's never been this slow.”

But we’re likely still in the midst of a transition, and experts say to look at pending sales data, which is cooling, according to a recent Compass report. Even with all this volatility, the Bay Area is a wealthy region and there are plenty of buyers paying with cash for whom mortgage rates don’t matter.

Bachaud said that it’s important to remember how differently housing markets like San Francisco and New York operate from the rest of the country. “In the rest of the country we’ve seen record-high home price appreciation, but in the Bay Area we didn't get even near the peak appreciation we saw in 2013,” she said. “As fast as the area was growing recently, it’s had faster periods of acceleration.”"
84,"According to new research from LendingTree, home prices have risen significantly over the past two years, and paying $1 million or more for a house seems excessive as well as unattainable to most Americans. However, just because million-dollar homes aren’t common throughout the U.S. doesn’t mean they aren’t prevalent in some areas.

To see where million-dollar houses are most common, LendingTree analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey to look at the share of million-dollar homes in each of the nation’s 50 largest metropolitan areas. While million-dollar homes aren’t prevalent in most of the nation’s largest metros, they do make up a large share of homes in some notoriously high-cost areas like San Jose and San Francisco, California.

Key findings

Million-dollar homes are relatively uncommon in most of the country. An average of only 4.71% of the owner-occupied homes in the nation’s 50 largest metros are valued at $1 million or more.
The prevalence of million-dollar homes can vary significantly by metro. For example, 52.89% of owner-occupied homes are valued at $1 million or more in San Jose, California, making it the only one of the nation’s 50 largest metros where a majority of owner-occupied homes are worth at least $1 million. In the metro with the smallest share of $1 million homes, Buffalo, New York, that figure is 0.56%.
Of the 10 metros with the largest share of million-dollar homes, the four with the highest percentage of million-dollar homes are in California. Driven by factors including dense populations and the significant wealth generated by the tech and entertainment industries, an average of 31.33% of owner-occupied homes across San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego are valued at at least $1 million.
Buffalo, N.Y., Cleveland and Pittsburgh have the smallest share of homes valued at $1 million or more. An average of only 0.61% of owner-occupied homes in these generally affordable metros are worth $1 million or more.

Since the start of the year, mortgage rates have risen drastically. These higher rates have made buying homes more expensive, even in areas where home prices haven’t necessarily increased.

With that said, because different lenders can offer different rates to the same person, it’s often possible for borrowers to find a lower rate on their mortgage by shopping around for a lender before buying.

A recent LendingTree study found that the spread between the highest and lowest APRs offered to borrowers across the nation’s 50 largest metros who received offers from three or more lenders was 82 basis points. To put that spread into perspective, the study found that those borrowers could have saved an average of more than $63,000 over the lifetime of their mortgages by choosing the lowest rate offered to them.
Though these savings aren’t exclusive to those looking to buy million-dollar homes, higher-cost borrowers are likely to see larger savings the lower the rate they get. As a result, if you’re planning on buying in a high-cost area, one of the best ways you can save money is by shopping for a mortgage before buying."
85,"June 28, 2022 -- For the third straight month median rents in Santa Monica rose by less than 1 percent in June, mirroring a slowing growth trend across the LA region.

Apartment List's monthly report released Tuesday found that rents in Santa Monica rose by 0.7 percent in June, after seeing a 0.8 percent increase in May and a 0.1 percent increase in April.

Currently, median rents in Santa Monica stand at $2,047 for a one-bedroom apartment and $2,551 for a two-bedroom, according to the report.

Santa Monica's 9.1 percent rent growth over the past year has failed to make up for the steep price drop during the coronavirus shutdown, leaving rents 2 percent below pre-pandemic levels, the report found.

It also is a slower rate of growth than the State average of 13.5 percent over the past year and the 14.1 percent average increase nationwide.

The nation's average 1.3 percent increase in June ""is continuing to pace ahead of pre-pandemic trends, even as it cools substantially from last summer’s peak,"" Apartment List researchers wrote.

Still there are signs the rental market will pick up some steam during the busy summer rental season, researchers said.

""While the apartment market has shown some signs of easing, our 5 percent vacancy index remains well below the pre-pandemic norm, and increased pressure in the for-sale market could translate to the rental market as well.

""Despite a recent cool-down, many American renters are likely to remain burdened throughout 2022 by historically high housing costs,"" the report predicts.

In larger communities across the Metro LA region rents remained relatively flat, ranging from an 0.4 percent drop in West Hollywood to an increase of 1.7 percent in Marina del Rey.

Rents in Marina del Rey are now by far the highest in the region, with a one-bedroom apartment going for a median rent of $4,240 and $4,920 for a two bedroom.

Year-over-year rent growth in Marina del Rey stands at 18.1 percent, double the 9.1 percent for Santa Monica.

Irvine, Huntington Beach, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and West Hollywood all had higher monthly rents than Santa Monica.

In June, 97 of the nation’s 100 largest cities saw rents increase, according to the report, which is based on listings posted on the popular rental site.

""New York City has seen the nation’s fastest city-level rent growth over the past year, while some of the hottest Sun Belt markets are finally showing signs of plateauing growth,"" the report found.

Rents in once red-hot Seattle and San Jose have seen only modest growth during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, pricey coastal metros, including San Francisco; Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, have ""consistently been sluggish compared to the national average.""

The San Francisco metro area is now the only region where the median rent is still below its pre-pandemic level, although by only 1 percent.

Apartment List Rent Report data is drawn monthly from the millions of listings on the site, according to the website.

The report calculates one-bedroom and two-bedroom rents and aims to identify transacted rent prices, as opposed to the listed rent prices."
86,"House Method released a study this month that found the Tampa Bay area is the hottest housing market in the country.

“The housing market has exploded in recent years due to fluctuating mortgage rates, high demand accompanied by low inventory, as well as remote working opportunities allowing millions to rethink their home base. Americans have begun to rethink their priorities in a living space, many prioritizing space and comfort while others have flocked to bustling metropolises, leading to an exponential increase in home ownership,” House Method noted. “We analyzed data on the 100 largest MSA’s (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) and ranked them according to seven factors, such as affordability, inventory and population growth.”

Some of the key findings of the study include:

Home prices increased by an average of 21 percent since 2021

The top 10 markets rarely have listings sit on the market for more than 15 days, 40 percent less than the national average (25 days).

Many of the hottest housing markets are also some of the least affordable as demand increases and inventory decreases

Home equity has skyrocketed, allowing sellers to make huge profits

Home prices are projected to increase another 14.9 percent before 2023, even with steep mortgage rate increases

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area led the list followed by the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale region in Arizona; the Austin-Round Rock region in Texas; the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area in Washington; the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara market in California; Raleigh, North Carolina; the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia area in the Carolinas; the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area in Southwest Florida; the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise market in Nevada; and Salt Lake City, Utah.

Other parts of the Sunshine State also made the list. The Lakeland-Winter Haven area ranked 12th on the list. The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford market placed 18th. The North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton area placed 28th with the Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach market right behind it in 29th and Jacksonville at its heels in 30th. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach market placed 39th. The Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville area ranked 94th."
87,"Having dropped 3.9 percent in April to a near decade low, the National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, a seasonally adjusted index for which 100 denotes “an average level” of activity, inched back up 0.7 percent in May to 99.9 but was down 13.6 percent on a year-over-year basis.

In the words of NAR’s Chief Economist, “[d]espite the small gain in pending sales from the prior month, the housing market is clearly undergoing a transition,” a “transition” that shouldn’t have caught any plugged-in readers by surprise.

Closer to home, pending sales activity in San Francisco proper has been down an average of over 20 percent over the past month despite a marked increase in inventory."
88,"The National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales increased 0.7% from last month to 99.9 according to newly released data, where an index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001. This contrasts with the median forecast of a 4% drop made by economists in a Bloomberg survey, and marks the first rise in sales recorded in seven months.

At the median single-family home price, with a 10% down payment, the monthly mortgage payment has increased by around $800 since January, the NAR noted. Meanwhile, mortgage rates are close to hitting their highest levels since 2008, further complicating affordability challenges brought on by high housing prices.

While rising rates are expected to make borrowing costs even more expensive, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expected this to temper demand for homes, ease price pressures, and flatten home prices “fairly quickly”. The Federal Reserve is currently raising interest rates to cool demand in the economy, including for housing, and tame decades-high inflation.

By region, contract signings in the Northeast and South rose, while those in the Midwest and West declined, NAR said. All four areas were down the year prior.

The pending home sales index is based on contract signings rather than when a contract closes. Sales of previously owned homes fell for a fourth consecutive month in May, receding to the lowest level in almost two years. Compared with a year earlier, contract signings were down by 12% on an unadjusted basis.

“Despite the small gain in pending sales from the prior month, the housing market is clearly undergoing a transition,” NAR’s chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement."
89,"Home prices across the United States set a new all-time record for price appreciation, rising at an annualized rate of 18.0 percent in May 2022 from April 2022, according to homegenius Home Price Index (HPI) data released today by homegenius Real Estate LLC, a Radian Group Inc. company (NYSE: RDN). The company believes the homegenius HPI (formerly Radian HPI) is the most comprehensive and timely measure of U.S. housing market prices and conditions available in the market today.

The homegenius HPI also rose 16.3 percent year-over-year (May 2021 to May 2022), a modest jump over the year-over-year increase of 15.7 percent recorded last month, both represented all-time records. The homegenius HPI is calculated based on the estimated values of more than 70 million unique addresses each month, covering all single-family property types and geographies.

“Despite increasing headwinds, home prices in the U.S. set new records once again in May,” said Steve Gaenzler, SVP of Products, Data and Analytics. “While home prices have been increasing at record paces, there are reasons to expect slowing appreciation rates in some or all of the country later this year. Historically, the rate of home price appreciation has been inversely correlated to mortgage interest rates; the higher the mortgage rate, the slower price appreciation occurs, and vice versa. Since January 2022, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage has surged by 285 basis points, the largest increase over six months since 1980 and the largest percentage increase in U.S. history. Rising from 3.2 percent at the start of 2022 to 5.78 percent in the latest weekly report, mortgage rates are 80% higher (256 basis points) than just six months ago. Strong home price appreciation combined with rapidly increasing mortgage financing costs is a double whammy for home affordability and consumer confidence,” added Gaenzler.

NATIONAL DATA AND TRENDS

Median estimated home price in the U.S. rose to $325,684
Percentage of lower-priced homes sold fell to lowest on record.
Nationally, the homegenius HPI estimated the median price for single-family and condominium homes rose to $325,684. Across the U.S., home prices nationally rose 15.5 percent over the last three months, much higher than the 13.2 percent reported for the three months from February through April. Home prices remain buoyed by a supply and inventory of homes for sale that continues to decline. While inventory of homes for sale rose by six percent in May from the prior month, supply was five percent lower than May 2021 and is 35 percent lower than the average of the month of May in 2017-2020.

The mix of homes sold by price band provides valuable information on what is driving home price growth. In May, only 23.3 percent of homes sold cost less than $250,000, the lowest recorded percentage for that category and roughly half of the 43.9 percent tally from just two years ago. In contrast, 34.6 percent of homes sold in May cost more than $500,000, which is more than 4.0 times larger than the 8.2 percent share recorded a decade earlier (May 2012). This shift towards higher-priced homes has a beneficial impact on the growth rate of indices that only measure home prices of sold properties (i.e., repeat sales and median sales price indices). The homegenius HPI measures the change in value to all properties based on the entire housing stock, not the mix of homes that happen to transact in a given month.

In May, the number of homes that were sold increased from the prior month by 2.6 percent. Over the first five months of 2022, the aggregate count of home sales nationally was 5 percent lower than the first five months of 2021. However, sales were five percent higher than the average of the same 5 months (Jan-May) in each of the prior four years (2017-2020).

REGIONAL DATA AND TRENDS

All U.S. Regions appreciated at a faster rate in May
South records 11th straight month as strongest region
In May, home price appreciation rose from the prior month in all regions. After finding a recent low in appreciation rates in February or March of this year, the homegenius HPI has seen stable growth in home prices broadly across geographies. The South (+21.5%), Mid-Atlantic (+17.4%), and Southwest (+17.3%) recorded the strongest month-over-month annualized gains. The South region has been the strongest region for eleven consecutive months, and fourteen of the last nineteen months.

All six regions recorded actual 12-month price appreciation rates between 13.0 and 21.5 percent, signaling a robust market in all parts of the U.S, although with wide disparity in performance. The result of the continued strong gains in home prices equates to record levels of homeowner equity. In aggregate, the rise in home values over the past year equates to more than $6.5 trillion dollars of new equity for homeowners.

METROPOLITAN AREA DATA AND TRENDS

Tampa Bay, FL leads all metro areas in appreciation rate
Slightly slower appreciation the norm in most, larger metropolitan areas
While all regions continued to report strong price appreciation rates in May 2022, only three metropolitan areas (Philadelphia, PA, Baltimore, MD, St. Louis, MO) recorded faster price appreciation when compared to the prior month (April 2022). Four metros (Tampa, FL, Atlanta, GA, Miami, FL, Dallas, TX) have reported three straight months of annualized one-month appreciation rates in excess of 20 percent. Tampa, FL was the strongest metro area this month (+26.5% annualized 1-month appreciation). While the general regional numbers remain strongly positive, this month’s slower readings in 17 metros (in a month that is typically rising due to seasonal influences) suggest that regional markets across the U.S. may start to show signs of slowing home price appreciation.

The metro areas that reported the largest slowdowns relative to the prior month are all in the West. Three metro areas in particular, San Francisco, CA, Seattle, WA, and San Diego, CA, showed substantial slowdowns in appreciation rates. The average annualized one-month change for each was down more than 45 percent from the prior month’s appreciation rate. Each of them, however, has a 12-month appreciation rate in excess of 10 percent.

In an unusual twist, Tampa, FL went from the weakest of our top metros one year ago to the strongest in May 2022, while San Francisco, the weakest this month, was actually the strongest one year ago."

91,"According to the National Association of Realtors, U.S. pending home sales crept higher in May 2022, ending a six-month streak of declines.

Regionally, month-over-month results were mixed as the Northeast and South experienced increases while the Midwest and West posted decreases. Year-over-year contract activity slid in all four major regions.

The Pending Home Sales Index, a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, inched up 0.7% to 99.9 in May. Year-over-year, transactions dropped 13.6%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.

""Despite the small gain in pending sales from the prior month, the housing market is clearly undergoing a transition,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. ""Contract signings are down sizably from a year ago because of much higher mortgage rates.""

According to NAR, at the median single-family home price and with a 10% down payment, the monthly mortgage payment has increased by about $800 since the beginning of the year as mortgage rates have climbed by 2.5 percentage points since January.

""Trying to balance the housing market by choking off demand via higher mortgage rates is damaging to consumers and the economy,"" Yun added. ""The better way to balance the market is through increased supply, which also helps the broader economy.""

While the housing market remains unbalanced nationwide with demand far outpacing supply, Yun noted variations in home prices and affordability contributed to the regional differences in pending sales activity in May.

""The largest decline in contract activity was observed in the West region, where homes are the most expensive,"" he said. ""This further indicates the growing need to increase supply to tame home price growth and improve the chances of ownership for potential home buyers.""

May 2022 Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown

The Northeast PHSI jumped 15.4% compared to last month to 86.7, down 11.9% from May 2021. The Midwest index retreated 1.7% to 98.6 in May, a decline of 8.8% from a year ago.

The South PHSI increased 0.2% to 119.0 in May, a 13.8% drop from the previous year. The West index contracted 5.0% in May to 81.6, down 19.8% from May 2021."
92,"Rising real estate values and increasing rents have stretched budgets for homebuyers and renters over the last two years. The median home sales price in the U.S. jumped by nearly $100,000 from the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2022 amid low interest rates and a stronger-than-expected pandemic economy. Rents were flat for much of 2020 with COVID-related renter protections and rental assistance programs in place but accelerated in 2021 and the first half of 2022. Median rent in the U.S. has increased by more than 15% over the past year and recently passed $2,000 per month for the first time.

Since the beginning of 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in efforts to combat inflation throughout the economy. Between rising mortgage rates and the rapid run-up in home values, the residential real estate market has shown recent signs of cooling. But while a leveling out in demand could slow the pace of price increases, these measures cannot solve another fundamental challenge in the U.S. housing market: a major shortage of housing supply.

Researchers at federal mortgage backer Freddie Mac have estimated that the U.S. has a housing supply shortage of 3.8 million units. This shortage has been fueled in large part by a decline in single family home construction, particularly for starter homes, dating back to the 1980s. And with millennials now comprising the largest generational segment of the homebuying market, a lack of affordable entry-level homes has driven competition for housing and kept larger numbers of young adults renting, contributing to price increases for buyers and renters alike.

The lack of housing supply has been exacerbated by significant underinvestment in new housing since the last recession. New housing authorizations tend to fall temporarily during economic downturns, but the collapse of the housing market in the mid-2000s and ensuing Great Recession sent annual housing authorizations to historic lows. New housing permits have recovered slowly over the last decade, only recently surpassing historic averages.

Despite recent demand and a clear need for new housing supply, the construction industry has struggled to keep up during the pandemic. COVID-related disruptions have produced worker shortages and hindered supply chains, making it harder and more expensive to obtain building materials. As a result, more single-family units are seeing monthslong delays in the time it takes to start and complete construction when compared to years past.

Although supply is a challenge across the U.S., some locations are moving faster than others in authorizing new construction. Fast-growing states in the Mountain West, like Utah, Idaho, and Colorado, along with Sun Belt destinations like Texas and Florida, lead the U.S. in the rate of new housing authorizations relative to existing homes. At the local level, major cities in these fast-growing states are also among the leading metros for new home construction.

To determine the metros building the most homes, researchers at Inspection Support Network analyzed the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Zillow. The researchers ranked metro areas according to the number of new housing units authorized per 1,000 existing homes in 2021. In the event of a tie, the metro with higher total new housing units authorized in 2021 was ranked higher.

93,"Ask 12 experts in real estate about the future of home values and you’ll probably get 20 or more different opinions. With mortgage rates rising, the housing market is expected to slow down, but that doesn’t mean that home values are going to decline. Here’s one prediction from GOBankingRates about home values in 2023.

Predictions for Home Values

GOBankingRates used the median home value rate to predict what home valuations will do over the next year. The median home value is the property’s actual valuation, not the list price or home price. It’s interesting to note that there were no predictions in which home values would decline. In most states, home values should increase by 10% or more. Only three states, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Alaska, had predictions of less than 10%. Some states, Utah, Florida, and Arizona had a prediction of over 20% gain.
Here are some of the predictions:

Texas – the median home value in 2022 is $290,527. The projected home growth is 15.29%.

West Virginia, the state with the lowest median home value of $129,518 has a projected one-year growth rate of 10.39%.

Tennessee – with a median home value of $276,250 in 2022, the projected growth rate is 18.19%.

Florida – the 2022 median home value is $373,735. By 2023, the projected home value change is 22.04%.

Hawaii – the state with the highest median home value of $972,147 has a projected growth rate of 16.65%.

The real estate market is promising

Although there were concerns that the pandemic would cause a housing crash, what we’re seeing is much different. It’s not even the housing bubble of 2008. Housing prices are rising because of a lack of supply and increased demand. There’s less likelihood of foreclosure today than 15 years ago, due to more stringent requirements. The housing market looks good, not just into next year, but hopefully over the next decade and more."
94,"Rising interest rates could cause cottage owners who took out a variable-rate mortgage in 2020-2021 to experience a 45 per cent jump in payments by 2025-2026, said the Bank of Canada in its Financial System Review. The bank did specify that this number is hypothetical and is based on further increases to Canada’s mortgage rate.

Considering the bank increased interest rates by 50-basis-points in both April and June, however, the chances of further increases are likely. The bank intends to reassess interest rates in July.

By increasing interest rates, the bank is attempting to cool market demand and combat the elevated inflation level, which reached a 31-year high of 6.8 per cent in May. While intended to lower the cost of living, the increased interest rates are causing a spike in mortgage payments.

“It’s like red flashing lights in our face. [Mortgage rates] have been climbing so aggressively, fixed and variable,” says Andrew Thake, a mortgage broker based in Ottawa. “Fixed rates were in the one to two per cent range a few months back, and now they’re almost at five per cent with the major banks.”

A five-year, fixed-rate mortgage tends to be the most popular mortgage package, Thake says. This means that the property owner is locked in at a certain rate for five years. Therefore, a property owner who took a mortgage out before the interest rates started to increase is currently unaffected. But once those five years are up and the property owner has to renew their mortgage, they’re likely to see a major jump in payments.

Similar to the 45 per cent increase in high loan-to-income variable-rate mortgages, the Bank of Canada hypothesized that a high loan-to-income fixed-rate mortgage taken out in 2020-2021 would also increase by 2025-2026, jumping 26 per cent. Mortgages obtained in 2020-2021 are expected to see the largest increase because they were taken out when rates were at record lows.

At the moment, Thake says the fixed-rate mortgages are rising much faster than variable-rate mortgages, which fluctuate and are based off the Bank of Canada’s overnight lending rate. This means that a variable-rate mortgage is giving people more purchasing power.

“If a household made $150,000, they had no debt, their current home was paid off with 20 per cent down, and they’re using a variable interest rate, they would qualify for a $940,000 loan,” Thake says. “But if that very same client used a fixed rate, they would qualify for about $820,000. That’s a massive difference.”

For Canadians who did take out large mortgages during the pandemic, the Bank of Canada says that these highly indebted households are a vulnerability to the financial system, especially if household incomes don’t increase along with interest rates.

But Thake says it’s unlikely we’ll see a major spike in defaulted mortgages in the near future. This is because anyone who took out a mortgage had to pass the mortgage stress test. This test shows lenders that you’ll still be able to make your monthly payments even if interest rates rise.

To pass the stress test, you have to show your lender that you can meet the Bank of Canada’s minimum qualifying rate, which was increased from 4.79 per cent to 5.25 per cent in June 2021, and is based on the mode average of fixed rates posted over the last five years by Canada’s big banks, or you must meet the mortgage rate offered by your lender plus two per cent, whichever’s higher.

The issue, Thake says, is that since fixed-rate mortgages have climbed so aggressively, they now sit around five per cent, which when you add the lender’s two per cent makes them closer to seven per cent. This means that potential buyers won’t be able to qualify for as large a mortgage as they could in previous years.

Additionally, since mortgage rates are rising so quickly, potential buyers might be pre-approved for a mortgage one week, but then no longer qualify for that mortgage a week later after the rate’s been raised. To make sure you’re on top of increasing rates, Thake suggests working with a mortgage broker.

“When’s the last time your bank called you and updated you on rates?” he says. “A broker manages a client like a financial planner does. We have a pool of 500 clients, and they get day-to-day devotion. We only really earn our living if we service that client and everything goes through smoothly.”"
95,"Canada’s banking regulator is tightening requirements for some types of real estate loans to protect homeowners who may be at greater risk from higher interest rates.


The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions says changes affect combined loan plans like reverse mortgages or loans with shared equity features, which have grown in popularity in recent years but may be riskier for lenders.

For borrowers who owe more than 65 per cent of the loan value, a portion of their payment must to go toward the loan principal rather than to interest until they bring the loan below that threshold.

OSFI says the changes will generally take effect the next time borrowers renew their plans after the end of fall 2023, in line with the lender’s fiscal year.

The regulator says consumers will not see an increase to their monthly payment requirements as a result of this change, nor will the move impact new homebuyers.

Bank of Canada data shows combined loan plans that are above 65 per cent loan to value account for $204 billion of the country’s $1.8 trillion in total outstanding residential mortgages."
96,"BOUDER, Colo. (Stacker) — As mortgage rates rise in concert with The Fed’s rate hikes this month, fears about the American housing market pricing out tens of millions of would-be homebuyers continue to fester.

The interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage is hovering around 6%.

And not only is it becoming more expensive to borrow money, but most real estate investors and builders have said they don’t anticipate housing prices will drop significantly but will instead grow at a slower rate.

There are signs this week, however, that the real estate market is shifting ever so slightly toward the buyer. May data shows home builders have started lowering prices for newly built homes as demand has cooled.

Home sales in May were down 8.6% year over year, according to the National Association of Realtors. It’s the fourth-straight month of declining activity. May also saw the median home price break $400,000 for the first time in history.

“We’re not going to see distressed sales, but we could see a decline in prices if the economy is hurt so bad that buyers just can’t afford the high prices that sellers want,” Redfin’s chief economist said this week in response to the release of housing data from May.

98,"WAYNE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Home prices across the United States set a new all-time record for price appreciation, rising at an annualized rate of 18.0 percent in May 2022 from April 2022, according to homegenius Home Price Index (HPI) data released today by homegenius Real Estate LLC, a Radian Group Inc. company (NYSE: RDN). The company believes the homegenius HPI (formerly Radian HPI) is the most comprehensive and timely measure of U.S. housing market prices and conditions available in the market today.

The homegenius HPI also rose 16.3 percent year-over-year (May 2021 to May 2022), a modest jump over the year-over-year increase of 15.7 percent recorded last month, both represented all-time records. The homegenius HPI is calculated based on the estimated values of more than 70 million unique addresses each month, covering all single-family property types and geographies.

“Despite increasing headwinds, home prices in the U.S. set new records once again in May,” said Steve Gaenzler, SVP of Products, Data and Analytics. “While home prices have been increasing at record paces, there are reasons to expect slowing appreciation rates in some or all of the country later this year. Historically, the rate of home price appreciation has been inversely correlated to mortgage interest rates; the higher the mortgage rate, the slower price appreciation occurs, and vice versa. Since January 2022, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage has surged by 285 basis points, the largest increase over six months since 1980 and the largest percentage increase in U.S. history. Rising from 3.2 percent at the start of 2022 to 5.78 percent in the latest weekly report, mortgage rates are 80% higher (256 basis points) than just six months ago. Strong home price appreciation combined with rapidly increasing mortgage financing costs is a double whammy for home affordability and consumer confidence,” added Gaenzler.

NATIONAL DATA AND TRENDS

Median estimated home price in the U.S. rose to $325,684
Percentage of lower-priced homes sold fell to lowest on record.
Nationally, the homegenius HPI estimated the median price for single-family and condominium homes rose to $325,684. Across the U.S., home prices nationally rose 15.5 percent over the last three months, much higher than the 13.2 percent reported for the three months from February through April. Home prices remain buoyed by a supply and inventory of homes for sale that continues to decline. While inventory of homes for sale rose by six percent in May from the prior month, supply was five percent lower than May 2021 and is 35 percent lower than the average of the month of May in 2017-2020.

The mix of homes sold by price band provides valuable information on what is driving home price growth. In May, only 23.3 percent of homes sold cost less than $250,000, the lowest recorded percentage for that category and roughly half of the 43.9 percent tally from just two years ago. In contrast, 34.6 percent of homes sold in May cost more than $500,000, which is more than 4.0 times larger than the 8.2 percent share recorded a decade earlier (May 2012). This shift towards higher-priced homes has a beneficial impact on the growth rate of indices that only measure home prices of sold properties (i.e., repeat sales and median sales price indices). The homegenius HPI measures the change in value to all properties based on the entire housing stock, not the mix of homes that happen to transact in a given month.

In May, the number of homes that were sold increased from the prior month by 2.6 percent. Over the first five months of 2022, the aggregate count of home sales nationally was 5 percent lower than the first five months of 2021. However, sales were five percent higher than the average of the same 5 months (Jan-May) in each of the prior four years (2017-2020).

REGIONAL DATA AND TRENDS

All U.S. Regions appreciated at a faster rate in May
South records 11th straight month as strongest region
In May, home price appreciation rose from the prior month in all regions. After finding a recent low in appreciation rates in February or March of this year, the homegenius HPI has seen stable growth in home prices broadly across geographies. The South (+21.5%), Mid-Atlantic (+17.4%), and Southwest (+17.3%) recorded the strongest month-over-month annualized gains. The South region has been the strongest region for eleven consecutive months, and fourteen of the last nineteen months.

All six regions recorded actual 12-month price appreciation rates between 13.0 and 21.5 percent, signaling a robust market in all parts of the U.S, although with wide disparity in performance. The result of the continued strong gains in home prices equates to record levels of homeowner equity. In aggregate, the rise in home values over the past year equates to more than $6.5 trillion dollars of new equity for homeowners.

METROPOLITAN AREA DATA AND TRENDS

Tampa Bay, FL leads all metro areas in appreciation rate
Slightly slower appreciation the norm in most, larger metropolitan areas
While all regions continued to report strong price appreciation rates in May 2022, only three metropolitan areas (Philadelphia, PA, Baltimore, MD, St. Louis, MO) recorded faster price appreciation when compared to the prior month (April 2022). Four metros (Tampa, FL, Atlanta, GA, Miami, FL, Dallas, TX) have reported three straight months of annualized one-month appreciation rates in excess of 20 percent. Tampa, FL was the strongest metro area this month (+26.5% annualized 1-month appreciation). While the general regional numbers remain strongly positive, this month’s slower readings in 17 metros (in a month that is typically rising due to seasonal influences) suggest that regional markets across the U.S. may start to show signs of slowing home price appreciation.

The metro areas that reported the largest slowdowns relative to the prior month are all in the West. Three metro areas in particular, San Francisco, CA, Seattle, WA, and San Diego, CA, showed substantial slowdowns in appreciation rates. The average annualized one-month change for each was down more than 45 percent from the prior month’s appreciation rate. Each of them, however, has a 12-month appreciation rate in excess of 10 percent.

In an unusual twist, Tampa, FL went from the weakest of our top metros one year ago to the strongest in May 2022, while San Francisco, the weakest this month, was actually the strongest one year ago.

99,"As interest rates rise, a good chunk of homebuyers have lost up to $165,000 in purchasing power on new homes in the last year, according to a recent study by online real estate brokerage Redfin.

Interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have jumped from an average low of 3% to about 6% in the last year alone. Because of those rate hikes, mortgage costs have shot up by a median increase of 49%. This has resulted in potential homebuyers being able to afford less on the same budget, Redfin finds.

At the end of 2021, a homebuyer with a monthly mortgage budget of $2,500 could afford a home worth up to $517,500. But for the four-week period ending June 15, 2022, that same homebuyer could only afford a home worth up to $399,750 — a $120,000 drop in purchasing power. The median monthly mortgage payment in the U.S. is $2,391 as of June, per Redfin’s data.

Even homeowners able to spend more than that are seeing diminishing value in the homes they can purchase. Buyers with monthly mortgage budgets of $3,000 or $3,500 have lost $141,250 and $165,000 in buying power, respectively, the study finds.

Redfin’s data makes a few assumptions: the mortgages include a 20% down payment, a 1.25% property tax rate, a 0.5% homeowners insurance rate and no homeowners association dues.

“Many house hunters now need to consider smaller homes — perhaps farther from their ideal neighborhood — or stick to renting if they’re priced out of the market altogether,” writes Redfin’s chief economist Daryl Fairweather in a blog post accompanying the data.

For sellers, “smaller homebuyer budgets mean they can no longer expect to get top dollar for their home.”

The study also looked at the share of homes that are affordable on a $2,500 monthly budget by metro area. With a jump in interest rates from 3% to 6%, the nationwide share of affordable homes fell by 16%.

However, the biggest drops in affordability were in places that became popular homebuying markets during the pandemic, and are often known for their low cost of living: Phoenix, Raleigh, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and Austin.

Expensive real estate markets like the Bay area or New York saw the smallest decrease in affordability, but only because those markets already had limited affordability for monthly mortgage budgets of $2,500."
100,"Rent stabilization update

On 21 June 2022, the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) approved, on a 5–4 vote, to allow rent increases on one- and two-year leases for stabilized apartments of 3.25% and 5%, respectively. There are approximately 1 million rent-stabilized apartment units in NYC, accounting for some 44% and 28% of the city's rental units and total housing stock, respectively. The RGB is composed of nine members appointed by the mayor—two of them represent tenants, two represent landlords, and the remaining five represent the general public. Not surprisingly, the increases were met with unhappiness from both tenants and landlords. Tenant advocacy groups broadly decried the increases as an undue burden on an already financially stressed tenancy, while landlords complained that the increases were insufficient to offset the rising cost of maintenance and repairs, particularly in light of the multiple years of de minimis increases. As Robert Ehrlich, an owner's representative on the RGB, said in a 21 June 2022 Bisnow New York City article, ""The cost of housing continues to go up, elected officials do little to nothing to stop it, and this board is tasked with making an impossible decision.""


421-a update

One of the reasons housing is so expensive in NYC is the dearth of available rentals, particularly in the affordable category. In light of the 15 June 2022 expiration of the 421-a property tax exemption program, the ongoing shortage of new construction in NYC is likely to persist. The most recent version of the 421-a program, also known as Affordable New York, provides multifamily developers up to a 35-year property tax exemption in exchange for a certain percentage of the units being considered ""affordable."" According to a February 2022 study published by the NYU Furman Center, approximately 70% of apartment construction between 2010 and 2020 utilized the 421-a exemption, with the median-sized property containing 10 units.


There has been significant debate as to the value of the 421-a program. Proponents argue that development would be cost-prohibitive without the tax exemptions, while opponents view it as a giveaway to landlords who have supposedly gamed the definition of ""affordable"" in their favor and simultaneously depriving the city of tax revenue. According to a study from the New York City Independent Budget Office, between 2023 and 2056, when the last exemptions for buildings that utilized 421-a expire, NYC will lose out on USD 25.7 billion in taxes as a result of buildings that were constructed/started under the current version of 421-a.


As with any program that involves tax exemptions, it is certainly possible that the spirit of the program was not always perfectly adhered to. That said, we believe that in the absence of the 421-a or a similar program, developers already facing stringent rent control laws, extraordinarily high land and development costs, and the overhang of potential unfavorable new legislation (discussed below) will be very cautious about committing new capital to the NYC apartment market.


Good cause eviction is tabled...for now

Albany's legislative session ended on 2 June 2022 without adoption of the Good Cause Eviction (GCE) legislation that had been proposed by State Senator Julia Salazar and Assembly Member Pamela Hunter. In place of the law, the legislature agreed to create a commission to study affordable housing. As we have written frequently in the past, we believe GCE in its proposed form is akin to de facto statewide rent control because, among other things, it would have applied to virtually every rental building in the state and limited rent increases to the greater of 3% or 1.5 times the inflation rate (CPI). In addition, landlords seeking to raise rent above those limits would be required to justify the increases in court. Further, tenants would have been guaranteed the right to lease renewal unless they had not paid their rent, violated their leases, or created a nuisance (where the burden of proof would be on the landlord).


The loss of the 421-a program, stringent existing rent control laws, and the tenant protections put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic have put significant stress on NYC landlords, many of whom are small business owners. Although we are sensitive to the high cost of living in New York and recognize that rents are a significant burden for many tenants, we do not believe limiting one’s ability to earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return on their capital is the proper solution. The biggest contributor to rapidly rising rent is economics 101—demand is significantly outstripping supply. In the absence of the ability to earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return, we believe developers and their capital will seek other alternatives.


Despite the recent failure of GCE, we believe the issue will resurface again. Senator Salazar tweeted the following on 2 June 2022 (which was picked up in a 7 June 2022 issue of Multi Housing News): ""The fight for Good Cause Eviction continues, just as it has for these past three-plus years, and it will continue until we win Good Cause Eviction protections for families across the state of New York."""
101,"New York’s luxury housing market is shifting after a strong start to 2022.

Sales of New York City condos priced at $10 million and more spiked 84% in the first half of the year compared to the same time in 2021, according to a report Tuesday from SERHANT. Co-op sales rose 100% in the same time period. 

Sales volume totaled $2.17 billion, up from $1.26 billion in the first half of last year and $1.11 billion during the same time period in 2020, the report said. 

“The super-prime market in New York had a robust start to 2022,” Garrett Derderian, director of market intelligence at SERHANT, said in the report. “It was the strongest first-half year since 2019, when an increase to mansion and transfer taxes took effect on July 1, which resulted in a flurry of activity in the first half of that year. Condos also sold at their fastest pace in years.” 

Indeed, the pace of sales has increased as well, with the average property spending 203 days on the market, compared to 328 days last year. There were 127 contracts signed for condos and co-ops priced at $10 million or more in the first half of 2022, slightly less than the 161 reported last year. 

“While the number of trades is slightly below the records set in 2021, the number of super-prime condo contracts is 28% above the rolling 10-year average, while cooperatives trades are down just 8%,” Mr. Derderian wrote. 

The median sales price across all property types was $13.7 million in the first six months of 2022, the report said. 

And while real estate sales in the city have “undeniably slowed over the last two months from the record 2021 year, we still see buyers engaging at this level if the home is priced correctly,” Mr. Derderian added. 

Meanwhile, out east in the Hamptons—the summer retreat for New York’s super-prime set—median prices were up 9% to $14.65 million, the report said. Sales are lagging because of a lack of quality inventory, but buyers are still out there. 

“Turnkey homes are the most in-demand and command the highest price,” Mr. Derderian wrote. “Most buyers across the Hamptons have little appetite to do major renovations in the current market given rising costs and supply chain disruptions. It simply takes too long to complete. This has driven up prices for move-in ready homes. They do not sit on the market for long.”"
102,"It’s easy to conclude from the craziness of New York City’s rental market — including that long line for a tiny, rent-regulated East Village apartment that made The Post’s cover — that what the city needs is more “affordable housing.”

But it’s not true. Not only do New York City and the state overall have more subsidized housing than anywhere else in the nation — we make inefficient use of such housing. And rent regulation is actually helping drive the scarcity and sky-high rents of other units.

To be sure, the sight of wannabe renters waiting more than an hour in hopes of snagging a 371-square-foot, one-bedroom, third-floor walk-up for $2,337 a month would be inconceivable in most of America. Consider that the median mortgage payment in Phoenix is just $1,500 a month — for 2,500 square feet. It’s no wonder the city is losing population to the Sunbelt.

But to conclude that Gotham’s rental market needs more “affordable” — that is, income-restricted — units ignores reality.

New York state has 490,000 subsidized-housing units, the most in the country, per the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, with some 359,000 units in the city. With 5% of the nation’s population, New York has 10% of directly subsidized housing units — including public housing; housing choice vouchers for individual households renting private units; and rental units in buildings whose construction costs have been subsidized by the federal Low Income Housing Tax credit, which requires a percentage of units be set aside for rental by low- and moderate-income households as defined by median area income.

That staggering number doesn’t even include the more than 1 million rent-stabilized units, whose owners must keep rents low no matter tenant income.

Both directly subsidized and rent-regulated apartments provide good deals for lucky tenants — but wildly distort the overall housing market. A New York University study of New York City rent-regulated units found that 23% of tenants had moved in more than 20 years ago, three times as long a period as in market-rate units. In core Manhattan, fully 30% of rent-regulated tenants had lived in their apartments 20 years or more.

Low turnover means that renters of units that might go on the market in other cities — as older tenants no longer need the space and want to limit their costs — have an incentive to stay put. So newcomers to the city — including those who might have been waiting in the long East Village line — are out of luck.

This isn’t a housing market — it’s a game of apartment musical chairs.

Lucky winners hit what amounts to the housing lottery — a low-rent apartment without time limit. The same is true for those who score a designated new construction “affordable unit,” for which rent regulation kicks in. A change in income doesn’t affect the rent in these units. Tenants could literally hit the state lottery number and see limited rent increases at best from the Rent Guidelines Board, which votes yearly on increases to rent-stabilized units. To say this is an inefficient use of scarce public resources is an understatement.

The public-housing system is no better. HUD reports that 30% of New York City Housing Authority tenants are “overhoused” — meaning they have more bedrooms than they need — even as long waiting lists are the norm. Again there’s no incentive to move so long as one has an artificially cheap apartment.

There are some commonsense solutions. NYCHA could offer buyouts to tenants with extra bedrooms — to make way for homeless families. High-income tenants could be disqualified from rent-stabilized units. Or better still, the whole crazy quilt of rent regulation could be swept away — making New York more like other cities, where housing is not a perennial crisis.

Instead, Gov. Kathy Hochul is pushing for an additional $25 billion in subsidized housing.  Incredibly, the cost of building tax-subsidized affordable units in New York state tops $400,000 — per apartment. That’s thanks to union-dictated prevailing wage laws and the high cost for developers, who must negotiate zoning regulations and political demands.

If housing subsidies were the path to prosperity and widespread affordability, New York state would long ago have achieved both. Instead, it has demonstrated that even the most extensive housing-subsidy program in the nation guarantees neither."
103,"Rising real estate values and increasing rents have stretched budgets for homebuyers and renters over the last two years. The median home sales price in the U.S. jumped by nearly $100,000 from the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2022 amid low interest rates and a stronger-than-expected pandemic economy. Rents were flat for much of 2020 with COVID-related renter protections and rental assistance programs in place but accelerated in 2021 and the first half of 2022. Median rent in the U.S. has increased by more than 15% over the past year and recently passed $2,000 per month for the first time.

Since the beginning of 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in efforts to combat inflation throughout the economy. Between rising mortgage rates and the rapid run-up in home values, the residential real estate market has shown recent signs of cooling. But while a leveling out in demand could slow the pace of price increases, these measures cannot solve another fundamental challenge in the U.S. housing market: a major shortage of housing supply.

Researchers at federal mortgage backer Freddie Mac have estimated that the U.S. has a housing supply shortage of 3.8 million units. This shortage has been fueled in large part by a decline in single family home construction, particularly for starter homes, dating back to the 1980s. And with millennials now comprising the largest generational segment of the homebuying market, a lack of affordable entry-level homes has driven competition for housing and kept larger numbers of young adults renting, contributing to price increases for buyers and renters alike.

The lack of housing supply has been exacerbated by significant underinvestment in new housing since the last recession. New housing authorizations tend to fall temporarily during economic downturns, but the collapse of the housing market in the mid-2000s and ensuing Great Recession sent annual housing authorizations to historic lows. New housing permits have recovered slowly over the last decade, only recently surpassing historic averages.

Despite recent demand and a clear need for new housing supply, the construction industry has struggled to keep up during the pandemic. COVID-related disruptions have produced worker shortages and hindered supply chains, making it harder and more expensive to obtain building materials. As a result, more single-family units are seeing monthslong delays in the time it takes to start and complete construction when compared to years past.

Although supply is a challenge across the U.S., some locations are moving faster than others in authorizing new construction. Fast-growing states in the Mountain West, like Utah, Idaho, and Colorado, along with Sun Belt destinations like Texas and Florida, lead the U.S. in the rate of new housing authorizations relative to existing homes. At the local level, major cities in these fast-growing states are also among the leading metros for new home construction.

To determine the states building the most homes, researchers at Inspection Support Network analyzed the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Zillow. The researchers ranked states according to the number of new housing units authorized per 1,000 existing homes in 2021. In the event of a tie, the state with higher total new housing units authorized in 2021 was ranked higher.

The analysis found that for every 1,000 existing homes in New York State in 2021, 4.8 new housing units were authorized, compared to 12.5 new units nationally. Out of all states, New York is building homes at the 6th slowest growth rate. Here is a summary of the data for New York State:

New housing units authorized per 1k existing homes (2021): 4.8
New housing units authorized per 1k existing homes (2019): 5.5
Total new housing units authorized (2021): 40,135
Total new housing units authorized (2019): 45,219
Percentage change in housing units authorized (2019–2021): -11.2%
Median home price: $393,063

For reference, here are the statistics for the entire United States:

New housing units authorized per 1k existing homes (2021): 12.5
New housing units authorized per 1k existing homes (2019): 10.2
Total new housing units authorized (2021): 1,736,982
Total new housing units authorized (2019): 1,386,048
Percentage change in housing units authorized (2019–2021): +25.3%
Median home price: $344,141"
104,"(The Center Square) – Despite rising mortgage rates and low inventories, the Illinois real estate market continued its momentum in May.

According to Illinois Realtors, sales were down but prices rose over 6% and homes sold quicker than a year ago. The average Illinois home sold in 24 days in May 2022, compared to 33 days a year ago.

“Prices increased again while the number of sales remains low throughout Illinois,” said Dr. Daniel McMillen, head of the Stuart Handler Department of Real Estate at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Business Administration. “The SHDRE forecast now indicates an increase in the number of sales over the next three months.”


Two of the hottest housing markets are downstate where sales and prices were up. The median price for a home increased in May year-over-year by 27.3% in the Kankakee area, and 23.4% in the Carbondale/Marion area.

In the Chicago Metro Area, the median home sale price in May 2022 was $327,000, an increase of 5.5% from $310,000 in May 2021.

Industry analysts say higher mortgage rates, which recently climbed to 6%, are likely to eventually douse the relentless escalation of home prices. Fewer buyers are submitting mortgage applications. According to Mortgage Bankers Association data, the decline is over 15% from a year ago.

As for low housing inventories, McMillen said there are still challenges for new construction.

“It has been really difficult for builders to be adding to the housing stock right now,” said McMillen. “There are still these major bottlenecks in supplies.”

With higher interest rates and home prices, Realtor.com economists now predict sales of existing homes will drop 6.7% compared to last year. They note fewer sales could give inventory levels a boost."
105,"Rising interest rates have put somewhat of a damper on San Diego’s resale housing market.

The median price of a single-family home dropped $10,000 in May from $1 million to $990,000, according to the Greater San Diego Association of Realtors, while the median price of condominiums and other forms of attached housing actually rose $10,000 to $670,000.

The price drop for single-family is particularly significant because it comes at a time of year when home sales historically have started to peak, and Association President Chris Anderson said that more cooling is likely as the effect of rising interest rates spreads.

“It isn’t accelerating like it was,” Anderson said.  “It didn’t tank. It kind of leveled. We still have the same number of sales, roughly.”

In May, 1,837 single-family homes were sold compared to 1,061 in April, according to the association.

Predicting that prices will continue to moderate, Anderson said that she doesn’t see a significant drop in prices.

“I don’t see the crash a lot of people say is going to be like 2007 or 2008. I don’t see that,” Anderson said, adding that inventory remains low and demand is strong.

Adjusting Search

Even with the rise in interest rates, Anderson said that she’s still seeing multiple offers on the homes she’s listing, and buyers in some cases are still willing to pay more than the listing price.

“Some things are sticking on the market and other things are flying off the market. It doesn’t matter what the price point is, it’s just whether it’s priced right in its group,” Anderson said.  “We still have a lot of people with a lot of money coming here. We might have a good summer but I don’t know what’s going to happen going into winter.”

Historically, winter is a slow time for housing sales.

While some people were surely priced out of the market by rising interest rates, Anderson said others are adjusting their housing searches.

As a rule, home prices are lower in East County and South County then in Central County and North County.

“If you don’t have the buying power that you once had, you may want to look in those areas and commute a little bit more. You’ll get more bang for your buck if you go inland,” Anderson said.

Fantastic and Challenging

Meanwhile, a national home listing service ranked San Diego near the bottom of the list of the 50 best cities to raise a family primarily because of the high housing prices.

“It’s twice more expensive to live in San Diego compared to the national average,” said Danetha Doe, an economist with Clever Real Estate, a real estate data service.

“It was really the economic factors that unfortunately place San Diego in the bottom 10,” Doe said. “Economically, it seems to be a tough place to raise a family unless a family is on the high end of the (economic) spectrum. If you are, it seems like a fantastic place to raise a family.”

Joining San Diego on Clever’s list of the worst places to raise a family based on economics were Riverside and Los Angeles.

The absolute worst place among U.S. cities surveyed is Detroit, according to Clever.

Topping the list of best places were Hartford, Connecticut; Milwaukee, Wisconsin;  and Providence, Rhode Island."
106,"In nearly every market (stocks, crypto, real estate, etc.), investors attempt to time the market cycles to maximize their profits. They follow the “buy low, sell high” philosophy and try to buy when prices are down and sell when they peak.

With that logic, the best time to buy real estate is when the market is significantly down.

However, the reality is that savvy investors have learned to build wealth in every phase of a real estate market cycle. The key is having a broad range of investing strategies and knowing which ones perform best for each market.

There is nothing wrong with buying at the bottom of a market cycle and selling at the top. Investors that have abundant capital ready and buy discounted properties during a crash often make a fortune when they sell.

However, you will be severely limited if this is the only investment strategy you know. Why? Because real estate market corrections don’t occur every year. In fact, the average time between housing market crashes is more than a decade.

If you decide to only buy investment property at the bottom of a crash, you will be sitting on the sidelines. All the while, other real estate investors build their portfolios with houses that produce rental income.

The truth is that the best time to invest in real estate is now. That’s as long as you implement the right strategies. This article will give you insight into how to invest in every phase of a real estate market cycle…

Introduction to Real Estate Market Cycles
Before we get into specific market cycle phases, it is helpful to understand how they typically operate as a whole. In general, home prices fluctuate in a sine wave, with the trend moving upward over time. For example, the value of a house at the peak of the current market will typically be higher than it was at the previous peak.

One characteristic of real estate is that it is much less volatile than other investment vehicles. Stocks, for example, are highly liquid, and investors can sell them at the push of a button.

On the other hand, real estate takes much more time to sell. The home buying process alone takes anywhere from 30 to 45 days. Even in a hot seller’s market, the time from which property owners decide to sell to when they actually close is typically a minimum of two months.

This illiquidity causes real estate to be much more sluggish than other types of investments. Beyond the fact that home sales take a significant amount of time, home prices are based upon recently sold homes, so it takes longer for them to drop or climb.

We’ve broken an entire market cycle into these four distinct phases:

Top Half of a Declining Market
Bottom Half of a Declining Market
Bottom Half of an Appreciating Market
Top Half of an Appreciating Market
There are certainly sub-phases within these periods, such as stable times without much change in home prices. But the framework we’ve laid out can also be applied during these times. And this should help with answering the question: when is the best time to invest in real estate?

Top Half of a Declining Market
All good things must come to an end. According to housing market trends, home prices reach an unsustainable peak every decade or so. A correction ensues when supply and demand invert due to these high prices.

The shift in supply and demand can occur from many causes. In the 2008 housing crisis, a high percentage of sub-prime home loans and homeowners’ mortgage payments increasing due to adjustable-rate mortgages caused a massive number of foreclosures.

Purchase demand can also be stifled by rising mortgage interest rates. When rates begin to climb, affordability decreases, which leads to fewer prospective buyers.

How to Invest When the Housing Market Turns Down
Although many real estate investors panic when a downturn occurs, others see it as a massive opportunity to accumulate more rental property.

However, it is unwise to purchase rental property using traditional methods at the beginning of a downturn. This is because these methods, such as buying in cash or getting a bank loan, require a significant amount of money out of pocket. Even when getting a loan on an investment property, you’ll be required to put down 20% of the purchase price. If the value and rent price drop, your equity position and cash-on-cash return will begin to look bleak.

But what if you could buy rental properties with little to no money down? That would change the game! Instead of worrying about whether or not the house will appreciate, you can stack cash flow properties and use hardly any of your own money. This is all made possible by creative financing.

What is Creative Financing?
Creative financing in real estate means buying or controlling houses without using traditional bank loans or your own money. In many cases, a real estate investor will purchase a home and simply take over the loan balance and payment of the seller. This approach is called buying the property subject to the existing financing.

A slight alternative to that approach is called a wraparound mortgage. In this case, a new loan is created that “wraps around” the existing mortgage. By wrapping around it, it exceeds the original balance and monthly payment.

If a house seller does not have a loan on the property, you can set up a seller take-back in which you make monthly payments to the seller instead of to a bank.

In all these cases, the down payment is entirely negotiable between the buyer and seller. That is the beauty of real estate investing. These strategies take using other people’s money to a new level and allow investors to add massive amounts of cash flow to their portfolios.

Why Does Creative Financing Work in a Declining Market
Don’t misunderstand – creative financing can work in any market. However, a declining market provides opportunities for creative financing that aren’t as apparent in a seller’s market.

For example, there is much less competition for real estate investors in a buyer’s market. When competition is high, it is difficult to get a creative financing offer accepted because another investor will offer to pay cash at the same price. But when sellers are more motivated to sell, they are more willing to consider creative options to receive a higher price.

Many times a downturn in the housing market results from higher interest rates. By implementing creative financing, investors are able to take advantage of the previously low rates and still purchase properties using leverage.

Bottom Half of a Declining Market
While the top half of a declining market is filled with fear and anxiety, the bottom half is typically marked with depression. Instead of holding onto the high house prices that once were, homeowners begin to accept that their homes are not worth near what they used to be.

This can be the best time to buy rental property because prices will be extremely low. The good part about buying during this time is that you will likely be ahead of the bulk of the competition. When the market turns upward, many investors will flood the market. By purchasing properties before this, you will be able to buy them at low prices and then capitalize on the appreciation caused by the influx of buyers.

How to Invest Near the End of a Declining Real Estate Market
The one thing investors should have in mind at the bottom half of a declining market is accumulating rentals. The low prices will allow you to get great deals that cash flow now and provide tremendous capital appreciation in the future.

Creative financing is still a great tool to use during this market phase. Beyond the reasons given earlier, many homeowners at this time will likely be underwater on their homes, meaning that their mortgage balance is higher than the market value of their home. This means they are essentially stuck with no way to sell because they would have to bring money to the closing table. These situations are where short sales and foreclosures become rampant.

Instead, you can save the day by structuring a creative finance deal. Even if the house has negative equity, it still might make sense to take it on if it will provide good cash flow. By doing this, you will be able to acquire as many rental properties as you can while using none of your own money.

While creative financing should be a strategy you use often during this time, it shouldn’t be your only focus. A cash offer will work better for some sellers, so you shouldn’t limit yourself to only using creative financing. Sometimes making a cash offer will allow you to get a much lower price.

Bottom Half of an Appreciating Market
Once the real estate market begins to turn upward, homeowners begin to feel hope, and buyers start to have confidence in purchasing a home. However, prices are still low at this point, and mortgage rates are typically low as well. This makes buying rental houses extremely lucrative. However, flipping also becomes an option since prices are appreciating, and many first-time homebuyers will be looking to buy a newly renovated home.

Buying Rental Properties Early in an Appreciating Market
Once the market begins to build momentum in the upward direction, you can confidently buy rental properties with the outlook of future appreciation. The only trouble is that many other investors will be thinking the same way. Because of this, you will have to get creative to stay ahead of them.

This might mean honing your marketing strategies to find off-market deals. While deals are easier to find in a depressed market, it gets much more challenging when prices are climbing. The best real estate investors have learned how to find their own deals instead of waiting for someone else to bring them to them.

In general, as the value of a home goes up, the fair market rent increases too. However, values typically climb faster than rent prices. This is why it usually makes more sense to buy rentals near the bottom of the market instead of at the top.

Top Half of an Appreciating Market
This phase of a market cycle is typically when real estate investors have the most competition. That’s because everyone has seen the rapid increase in prices over the recent years. However, as Warren Buffet has said, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”

Hopefully, you have already accumulated rental properties at this point and don’t feel the need to compete with investors making aggressive offers. It is tough to find rental houses at the top of the market that offer the same cash-on-cash return as those closer to the bottom. Although rent prices are generally higher at this point, home prices are even higher percentage-wise, so the rent-to-value ratio is significantly lower.

However, this does not mean you should pull back and not invest near the top of a market. It just means that you should adjust your investing strategy.

Flipping Houses in an Appreciating Market
The top half of an appreciating real estate market has been deemed by investors as a “cash-grab” market. Instead of growing a rental property portfolio at this time, many investors focus on quick-turn strategies such as flipping houses to quickly build capital.

One of the perks of flipping houses in an appreciating market is that many times the value is significantly higher when the house is completed than it was projected to be at the beginning of the project. In markets with extreme appreciation, it isn’t unheard of for the after repair value of a house to increase by tens of thousands of dollars over just a few months.

The fear of most investors in a market that has seen significant appreciation is that it will soon experience a correction. And this does happen periodically. The investors that purchased rental properties during this time banking on future appreciation can get stuck.

That’s why flipping is much safer at this point in a market because most house flippers try to complete a project in a few months. That isn’t enough time for most markets to see a significant decrease in prices.

You Can Make Money Investing in Any Real Estate Market
It’s true. While many people think it’s a good time to invest when the market is hot, a down market provides more opportunities to build an investment property portfolio.

The key to success in any market is having a broad understanding of investing strategies. On top of that, you need to know which ones to employ at different times. Here is a brief summary of the investing strategies we’ve suggested for each market cycle phase:

Top Half of a Declining Market: Creative Financing
Bottom Half of a Declining Market: Creative Financing and Traditional Rentals
Bottom Half of an Appreciating Market: Traditional Rentals and Flipping
Top Half of an Appreciating Market: Flipping

Have you ever wished you could give your home a new look without the high cost and time commitment of a complete renovation? If you’re willing to do a little work, there are plenty of DIY projects you can do to transform your space, all without a contractor. The key to choosing the perfect home improvement job is to first think about what you want to accomplish, and then consider how much time you want to spend on it. While all of these projects are easy to do, some take more time than others. So you want to make sure you know what you’re getting into when you start. The good news is that none of these projects should take you more than a weekend or two, and many of them can be done in a few hours or less.

Home improvement is a pretty broad topic, especially if you’re one of those people who watches shows or reads about styles, trends, and possible improvements. But it’s not always about the looks – some upgrades are just about making the house work better! That means you could install central air conditioning, move a door, or change the type of windows. No matter what you’re looking for, a home improvement is a valuable way to reinvest in your space. As professionals who invest in creating great homes, make sure the improvements you make are affordable while adding value.

Freshen up your rooms with paint

You can add a pop of brilliant depth to your dull, drab walls (or wash away your decorative sins with pristine white) simply by taking a can of paint and working on it. That’s the power of a coat of paint: it rearranges your reality. Because of this, painting is the most commonly tackled DIY upgrade by home improvement enthusiasts.

You don’t have to be a professional to learn to paint as such, but a good paint job is much more than just smearing a little paint on the wall. See our guides to expertly refinish your walls in a weekend, from the first scratch with the grinder to the last brush stroke.

Plan your project and get bids well in advance

Have you ever tried to find a contractor to start your new three-season porch in March that you want to finish by Mother’s Day? It will cost more than if you found a contractor in January. Most contractors plan months in advance and don’t want to disrupt their schedules.

They’ll make you a high offer because they really don’t want to please you…unless you pay a high price. Most construction jobs have high and low seasons.


 
Add value when possible

If you’re not sure where to start with home improvement projects, it can help to prioritize projects that will add value to your home. Renovated kitchens and bathrooms are almost always a safe bet, as are renovations that add square footage, like finished basements and decks.

But buyer preferences vary from market to market, so focus on what’s popular and valuable where you live, rather than broader national trends.

Swap out old accessories

It’s amazing what a new lamp can do in a room. Place these frosted glass pendants in the kitchen for modern glass globe lights with Edison bulbs; hang a chandelier above the master bed; Throw out your old ceiling fans and replace them with newer, more efficient fans. As long as you’ve run the wires, replacing new lights is a quick project that will greatly enhance any space.

Add crown molding the easy way

Crown molding is at the top of most remodeling lists because it adds charm and value to a home, not because people like to spend a Saturday fixing corners. Fortunately, there is an easy way to overcome miter saw frustration.

Canamould Extrusions Trimroc molding is a lightweight polystyrene foam coated with plaster of paris. It cuts cleanly with a handsaw and goes up in no time with joint compound. No coping, no tricky angles and frayed joints go away with a dollop of mud. Here’s how you can transform a plain room into a chic space in just one weekend, leaving plenty of time for the rest of your list.

Pay extra for energy saving features

With energy prices rising, many building companies are offering energy efficiency upgrades (at additional cost). These may include higher efficiency windows; guaranteed tightness; extra thick insulation; and heating, cooling or other higher efficiency devices. If they don’t offer this, you can ask what additional steps they (or you) can take to improve the energy efficiency of your home.

Then compare the estimated energy savings to the cost of each upgrade. A payback period of seven to ten years is good. (Simple payback is the time it takes for the savings to equal the original cost.) Please note that upgrades made during the remodeling process will always cost less than upgrades added later.

Get your tools right

You can’t really improve your home with your bare hands – most projects require at least one multi-tool. Before starting any project of any size, make sure your toolbox actually has the tools you need.

Keep in mind that some types of projects require special equipment, especially when it comes to plumbing or electrical systems. When in doubt, look it up on Google.

Go for a yellow glow

Speaking of lights, you can completely transform the ambiance of your home for the better by simply replacing all the harsh white bulbs with calming yellow ones.

Make sure you opt for LED so your new bulbs will last a long time. Another way to maximize your home’s interior brightness: Install dimmers in place of existing light switches to adjust each room’s brightness based on mood and time of day.

boost natural light

If you’re looking for home renovation tips, consider improving natural light throughout your home! Remove old windows and install large floor-to-ceiling windows.

Install skylights in your bathrooms. Or simplify your project by simply painting the interiors white to better reflect light throughout your home!

Install an inexpensive stair runner

Do you want to get a good grip on slippery stairs? Try a DIY runner. After receiving an offer of $2,500 to carpet his dangerously slippery oak staircase, TOH reader Jaime Shackford took the project into his own hands.

Using just two off-the-shelf woven runners ($125 each) and accessories from a home center, she gave her stairs a slip-resistant upgrade.

hack your furniture

If you’re sick of your old furniture but don’t want to pay the replacement cost, go for the better option and upgrade your existing furniture.

There are tons of creative ways to breathe new life into old furniture, like painting, reupholstering, and using sticky contact paper to add shapes and designs.

finish the basement

A great home improvement project to consider is finishing your basement! A finished basement not only gives you more livable square footage that can be used for a family room or entertainment area, it also has a great return on investment and can help you sell your home faster!

108,"The United States has seen steadily rising property values and reduced housing inventory recently. The median single-family home price climbed to $580,000, up 24% compared to a median price of $469,000 just a year ago.

Low inventory coupled with population growth means many, if not most, properties are experiencing a bidding war—multiple buyers fighting to get their offer accepted.

So how do you make your home purchase offer stand out from the pack? Mountain America Credit Union has some thoughts on the subject!

If you've been considering purchasing a home, you're probably aware of some of the basic tips for buying in a seller's market. Here are some to refresh your memory:

Get preapproved and submit this letter with your offer. It tells the seller that you can afford to purchase the home and you're ready to act.
Choose a real estate agent with a proven track record and the desire to go the extra mile.
Write the seller's preferred closing date into the offer.
Don't offer less than asking price (unless the property is grossly overpriced, of course).
The game gets more intense when you're faced with a seller's market that is as competitive as the one we are experiencing right now. Here are 10 tips to push your offer to the top of the pile:

Find out what's important to the seller and craft your offer around that. It's all about being a hassle-free buyer. For example, they may want a quick closing because they have to start a new job in a different state, or they may want to stay in the house a month or two after the sale of the house. Whatever it is, try to accommodate it in your offer.
Keep your offer friendly. Stay away from demands that are likely to irritate or frustrate the seller. Don't let a few hundred dollars—or even a few thousand dollars—stand in the way of getting the home you want.
Start with your best offer. In this market, there is no guarantee that you'll get a chance to counteroffer. If this is a multiple-offer situation, low offers are usually rejected immediately. Figure out the most you're willing to pay for a property and offer that amount from the start.
Show you're serious with more earnest money. Show the seller that you're willing to put your own money on the line to let them know how much you want to buy their home. It used to be that you could get away with a $500 earnest money deposit. No longer—1% is customary, but if you can, consider putting down between 2% and 3%. The seller wants to know you have some skin in the game.
Designate some of your earnest money as non-refundable. When you show in your offer that some of your earnest money is non-refundable after negotiations reach a certain point, it can go a long way in showing that you're serious about buying the property.
Cash is king. Not everyone can pay for a house with cash, but if you can, you may have a leg up on other non-cash offers. This just lets the seller know that your offer is not contingent on receiving loan approval.
Shorten inspection time frames. Whether the buyer has a set number of days to complete the inspections or they are proposing their own schedule to the seller, shortening the expected timeline could improve your odds of success. Discuss the pros and cons with your agent and decide if this is a good option.
Keep contingencies to a minimum. As a buyer, you have the right to add contingencies to your offer. That means you are offering to purchase the property as long as certain things happen, such as getting loan approval, the property getting appraised appropriately, or the inspection coming back without any major complications. To make your offer more engaging, you may consider waiving one or more of these contingencies. Keep in mind that this can be a risky strategy. If you waived the appraisal and the home appraises below the sales price, you would be on the hook to pay the difference or the loan may not be approved.
Write the seller a personal letter. This strategy gives you the opportunity to talk to the seller about why you are going to love this house as much as they do. Appeal to their emotions by listing the reasons why the house will be so perfect for your family. Does it have a workshop? Explain how you've always wanted a place of your own for projects and crafts. Does it have a great backyard? Talk about your dream for it to be ""the place"" where all your kids and their friends hang out.
Quick closing. If you can offer a 21-day closing instead of 30, this is a plus for many sellers. For some, it can be more important than the price itself. Be sure to consult with your lender to see if they can accommodate this timing.
The bottom line is to be creative. Talk to real estate agents and research online for inspiration. Now is the time to have an open mind and try things you may not have considered to secure the home you want.

Escalation clauses

If you're willing to make a higher offer but you don't want to outbid everyone by a mile, you could consider adding an escalation clause to your offer.

How does it work? Say you make an offer on a house for $400,000 and you think there will be significant competition for the property. You have no idea how much other potential buyers are offering, but an escalation clause states you'll pay a certain amount above any offer, up to your budget limits.

In this case, you could state that you'd beat competing offers by $1,000 up to $420,000. This helps you outbid other buyers without stating it upfront and potentially overpaying. If you were incorrect in assuming there would be competition for the home, you won't have to spend additional money for no reason.

This can be a risky strategy though. The seller could just counteroffer with your top price. Be sure to fully weigh this option by knowing how much this will impact your budget before presenting it.

One last piece of advice

House hunting in a seller's market can be frustrating. While it can be difficult to overcome the stressful process and the emotional attachment to homes that fit your dreams, remember that ""perfect"" is subjective and has many meanings. The perfect home is often what you make of it after you move in."
109,"Summer signals a time to relax by a swimming pool or lake, read under a tree or take a nap on a cool porch. For homeowners, the seasonal change in weather should also trigger a reminder to take care of home maintenance tasks, especially those that are easier to do when the weather is pleasant. In addition, it’s smart to prepare your home for potential intense summer storms.

“When it comes to home maintenance, the adage ‘An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure’ is particularly appropriate,” wrote John Campitell in an email. Campitell is production manager for InSite Builders & Remodeling in Bethesda, Md. “In the summertime, it is especially important for a home maintenance plan to emphasize exterior items. With friendlier weather and warmer temperatures, a lot can be seen, and a lot can be accomplished that will set up your home well for the rest of the year,"" he said.

We asked Campitell and George Noble for summer maintenance tips. Noble works in business development for WilderWorks, a home renovation division of Anthony Wilder Architecture in Cabin John, Md. Both responded via email. The following was edited for length and clarity.

Summer maintenance checklist:

1. Clean or replace filters and grills. Replace furnace filters, clean return air grills, kitchen hood vents, etc. Items such as these should be done on a quarterly basis. Replacing and/or cleaning filters keeps equipment working at optimum efficiency and flow while preventing stress to the point of failure, Campitell wrote.

2. Have your roof inspected. If your roof is more than 10 years old, it’s time to have it checked for damage, Noble wrote.

3. Adjust doors and tighten loose handles. Temperatures and humidity influence the functionality of doors and handles, Campitell wrote. In the summer, moisture and humidity can cause doors and handles to expand and stick, and, in the winter, drier and colder conditions cause doors and handles to shrink and loosen.

4. Check your windows, screens, storm windows and doors. Make sure they close and seal properly, Noble wrote.

5. Inspect showers and tubs, and replace caulking if required. Inspecting showers and tubs and replacing broken or missing caulk prevents water from seeping into walls where it remains hidden until water damage has taken hold. A $6.95 caulk replacement is preferable to a $695 repair for moisture damage behind walls, Campitell wrote.

6. Check your landscape. Make sure trees and shrubbery are not rubbing or touching the roof or sides of your house, because they could cause damage during a storm, Noble wrote.

7. Do an exterior visual inspection. Look for any issues needed to be corrected before fall season, Campitell wrote. “When weather conditions are favorable, it is easier to inspect for problems with decks, roofs, gutters, mortar or foundation cracks, and the warmer temperatures are also favorable for making the repairs,” he wrote. “In cold weather materials like roof shingles can become brittle.”

8. Inspect gutters and downspouts. Make sure they’re clear of debris and are secure and drain properly; add gutter guards or screens to help keep debris out, Noble wrote.

9. Check the grade around your house. Make sure the ground is sloped away from your house and downspouts flow away from your foundation to prevent water from seeping into your home, Noble wrote.

10. Do a safety inspection. Clean out your dryer vent, check your washing machine hoses, check fire extinguishers and your toilet supply line, which are important checklist items from a safety point of view. “Washing machine hoses are under considerable pressure all the time,” Campitell wrote. “If they are old and need to be replaced, a simple inspection can prevent a major water/house flooding situation.”

11. Check out your attic. Inspect and add attic insulation, Noble wrote. “It should be R-38 or better in this area,” he wrote. “Make sure your attic is well ventilated; it will prolong the life of your shingles and reduce attic heat and moisture.”

12. Consider pressure washing. Pollen, dirt and environmental factors take a toll on the exterior of a home, Campitell wrote. Pressure washing siding, windows, masonry, walkways, brick and flagstone patios prevents environmental chemicals from breaking down mortar, paint, seals, joints, which protect a home from moisture leaks."
110,"What goes up appears to be coming down, at least where South Coast home sale prices are concerned, according to an economic indicator in the data dashboard posted by the South Coast Chamber of Commerce. According to the Chamber’s dashboard, the sales value of South Coast home sales in June has declined by 2.7 percent over the last year. This shift may reflect the bump in interest rates now charged for home loans. 

In dollar amounts, the Chamber reports the median sale price on the South Coast is now $2.35 million, down from $2.4 million the year before, but still considerably higher than the $1.26 million of two years ago. (These numbers are considerably higher than those reported by longtime Realtor Mort Maizlish, who stated that the Multiple Listings Service reports the median asking price for the first three weeks of June was $1.7 million; during that same period, Maiszlish reported the median sale price was $1.8 million.)

For renters, the picture is less mixed. South Coast median rents have increased from $2,054 in June of last year to $2,293 in the same month this year.  Reported vacancy rates have dropped from 2.8 percent last year to 1.9 percent this year. Two years ago, the reported vacancy rate was 3.9 percent. 

In other quality-of-life metrics, the Chamber reported that violent crimes reported to and by the Santa Barbara Police Department had declined 13 percent from the year before and that property crimes had declined by 11 percent. Call volumes reported by the police declined by 2 percent."
111,"There were just 777 mortgages in arrears – defined as three months behind on payments – out of a total of 711,354 mortgages in the province at March 31, 2022. This worked out to a record-low arrears rate of just 0.11 per cent.

The number of mortgages in arrears has been in long-term decline since peaking at 0.49 per cent in early 2011. Despite rising to 0.18 per cent during the early summer of 2020 as borrowers adjusted to the financial turbulence caused by the pandemic, the arrears rate in B.C. has been trending down since January 2021.

B.C.’s rate is the lowest in Western Canada, and the second lowest in the country after Ontario, where just 0.06 per cent of mortgages were in arrears.

Most provinces in Western Canada have seen the rate of mortgages in arrears improve over the past year. In Alberta, the rate now stands at 0.44 per cent. In Manitoba, the rate is 0.28 per cent.

The one exception is Saskatchewan, which led the country in March with an arrears rate of 0.62 per cent. While this is a significant improvement from 0.76 per cent a year ago, it is an increase of two basis points since last fall.

The long-term decline in arrears in B.C. reflects the strength of the provincial economy.

A cooling trend could change the picture, however. TD Economics flags the risk high levels of household debt in B.C. pose in its provincial economic forecast released June 22.

“Households in the province are carrying the largest debt burden in the country, enhancing their exposure to higher interest rates,” it said.

While mortgage statistics indicate that homeowners have so far been able to service those high debt levels, this may not be the case if the economy slows.

TD Economics forecasts at economic growth in B.C. to drop by more than half over the next year. A similar decline is expected in the other Western provinces. Alberta is set to weather the storm best, with growth of 5.5 per cent this year and 2.8 per cent next year – the strongest in Western Canada."
112,"As higher interest rates continue to squeeze spending power — and rising inflation shows no indication of slowing — Canadian home prices and sales will dip considerably, according to the nation’s largest lender.

TD Bank has officially downgraded their forecast for the housing market compared to their take in March, due to monetary policy tightening at a faster-than-expected rate. The Bank of Canada (BoC) has implemented three hikes to its trend-setting Overnight Lending Rate (OLR) since March, bringing the benchmark cost of borrowing to 1.5% from the record-low 0.25% it had hovered at throughout the pandemic. As consumer lenders base their Prime cost of borrowing on this rate, qualification thresholds and payments have risen markedly for variable mortgages and line of credit products.

TD expects the OLR to rise an additional 1.75% before the central bank finishes its hiking cycle, hitting a termination point of 3.25% by the last quarter of this year.

That’s going to continue to weigh heavily on housing activity, says the bank, which now forecasts a 33% “peak-to-trough” decline in Canadian home sales from Q1 2022 to Q1 2023, before buying activity starts to stabilize. In all, sales will drop 23% on an annual basis this year, and 12% next. 

That will result in a 19% drop in average home prices over the same time frame. “However,” states TD’s release, home prices are “likely to grow modestly thereafter, alongside some recovery in demand.”

According to the Canadian Real Estate Association, national home sales have cooled rapidly since the BoC’s first hike, with activity dropping 21.7% year over year, and 8.6% month over month, in May. Prices fell 4.6% from April to an average of $711,116; more than a $100,000-decline from the price peak recorded in February.

TD expects the largest price drops will be felt in Ontario and British Columbia, as home value return closer to fundamentals following “significant affordability deteriorations during the pandemic,” while Quebec will see price growth, though modest, following its own price run up in early 2020.

The Prairie provinces, however, are set for a considerable correction. In Alberta, “sales are expected to retrench significantly from their record highs. However, they should remain closer to pre-pandemic levels than either B.C. and Ontario through 2023, supporting tighter markets and stronger price growth.” 

The ‘wild rose’ province has experienced a dramatic uptick in demand over the last couple of years, popular with both investors and end-user homebuyers for its relatively lower average home price, compared to Canada’s other large urban centres; benchmark home prices in Calgary and Edmonton are in the $400,000 – $600,000 range, in contrast to over $1.2M in Greater Toronto and Greater Vancouver.

Other Canadian provinces, however, can expect a smoother ride given their overall better affordability conditions; strong population growth and a tight sellers’ market in the Atlantic provinces will support local prices, though rising rates could make a dent moving forward."
113,"Tenants in rent-controlled Ontario homes may see their bills increase by as much as 2.5 per cent next year, with the province announcing the highest rent cap in nearly a decade amid soaring inflation.

The cap applies to most private rental units across Ontario, though rent control laws don’t cover rentals that were first occupied after Nov. 15, 2018. It’s a marked increase from the 1.2 per cent maximum allowed in 2022 — but the province says its lower than it could be given inflation rates.

The annual maximum is determined using Ontario’s Consumer Price Index, a monthly inflation marker. With inflation skyrocketing lately, the province said that index suggested a cap of 5.3 per cent — but the maximum increase had been capped at 2.5 per cent to avoid tenants facing “significant” rent hikes.

Across the country, households are grappling with record-level inflation, which has increased the cost of trips to the grocery store or stops at the gas station. Canada’s annual inflation rate jumped to 7.7 per cent in May, which was the highest seen since January 1983, Statistics Canada said. The jump was largely attributed to higher gas prices — with gas excluded, the consumer price index went up 6.3 per cent.

But while the rent cap announced Wednesday is below the rate of inflation, it’s the highest allowed in Ontario for nearly a decade, with a 2.5 per cent increase last permitted in 2013. The 2023 rate comes two years after the province enacted a rent freeze — or zero per cent cap — in response to the pandemic.

At Queen’s Park, interim NDP Leader Peter Tabuns said the cap is too high for many renters, as inflation erodes their incomes.

“I talk to tenants all the time in my riding. They are not getting pay increases. They’re not getting two and a half per cent. They’re not even getting one per cent,” Tabuns said.

“They are going to have a very tough time.”

It’s a concern shared by Cole Webber, a legal clinic worker and housing advocate in Toronto’s Parkdale neighbourhood, saying a 2.5 per cent rent increase is “not something that working class people are able to afford at a time when inflation is so drastically high.”

Across the whole rental market, he noted the average market cost to rent went up faster than the provincial increases — since landlords are able to increase rents by any amount between different tenants, as well as apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board for above-guideline hikes.

In the decade from 2012 to 2022, city data shows the average market cost for a one-bedroom unit in Toronto went up 48 per cent, which includes all market rental properties and not just those listed for new tenancies.

Tony Irwin, president of the Federation of Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario, said he recognized the challenge that record-high inflation was presenting in people’s lives — but noted that landlords’ costs, from utilities to maintenance, had also been on the rise.

“That impacts different-sized operators differently. Certainly, smaller landlords, it’s tougher for them to withstand the mounting costs,” he said.

The 2.5 per cent bump is not mandatory or automatic. Tenants who’ve lived in their homes for at least a year are required to receive at least 90 days’ notice from their landlords if their rent is set to increase."
114,"(Bloomberg) -- A Los Angeles city-run program for lower-income first-time homebuyers is increasing its maximum down-payment assistance by as much as $50,000, as residents struggle with rising prices in one of the US’s least affordable housing markets.

The city council voted unanimously Tuesday to raise the assistance limit for lower-income buyers to $140,000, up from $90,000, while the cap for middle-class households was increased by $40,000 to between $90,000 and $115,000, depending on the family’s earnings.

House prices are so high in the city that they’re pushing more and more people out of the market. The Los Angeles area has the lowest homeownership rate of any major US city, at 45.2% of residents, falling from around half in 2015, according to first-quarter data from the US Census Bureau. At the same time, housing prices have been rising faster than incomes, leaving residents with less money to put down a deposit and get a mortgage.

“Over the last five years, we have seen an increase of over 50% of home value in Los Angeles,” said Nury Martinez, president of the Los Angeles City Council and author of the motion during Tuesday’s meeting. 

“Buying a home should not be an unattainable goal, and as young people are forced out of the neighborhoods they grew up in, this city can no longer ignore the problem.”

The assistance programs offer loans with a zero percent interest rate -- though there is a shared appreciation provision -- to help buyers cover the down payment, closing and acquisition costs. The new limits will start July 1. 

The median home price in the Los Angeles metropolitan area is $792,470, according to the California Association of Realtors. That’s more than twice the US median of $368,200. Adding rising mortgage rates into the mix, and housing prices across the country are suddenly getting even more expensive.

Homebuyers need a 20% down payment for a conventional mortgage, which would be $158,500 for a median-priced home.

The lack of affordable housing in Los Angeles has also been driving more people onto the streets. The county has around 66,500 people experiencing homelessness, second only to New York City, according to 2020 data, the latest available.

Homeownership rates are also unequal across demographics. 

According to a 2021 report, while 34% of White households and 31% of Asian households in Los Angeles could afford a median-priced home in the area, only 15% of Hispanic or Latino and 14% of Black households could do the same.

“It’s also about gender equity and racial justice in the city,” Martinez said on the importance of first-time home loan assistance for lower income households."
115,"The single-family housing market has been on a steep incline over the past couple of years as home price appreciation has skyrocketed. Historically low-interest rates and demand far exceeding supply led to a frenzy of activity from buyers and investors in the past couple of years. However, what goes up must come down. And we are starting to see that now. Increased interest rates and higher monthly mortgage payments are taking the cost of owning a home out of reach for many, and as a result, the rental market is becoming increasingly attractive.

Home prices and interest rates are continuing to rise in tandem, especially in high population growth markets in the Sun Belt region like Phoenix, making it increasingly difficult for first home buyers. According to a recent Redfin study, home buyers in the Sun Belt need 40% more income than they did a year ago, while across the U.S., they need 34% more income.

In Phoenix, buyers must earn $87,026 to afford the metro’s average monthly mortgage payment of $2,176, up 45.7% from a year earlier. Phoenix has a median household income of $67,068 and an average rental rate of $1,667.

As a result, many renters are choosing to continue to rent, because becoming a first-time buyer is simply out of reach. A recent study by RealPage Inc. found that more than 57% of tenants in market-rate units with an expiring lease chose to renew in the past year compared to 51% between 2010 and 2019. Renters do face significant rent increases, but it is still less costly than the mortgage payments they would have to endure coupled with a down payment.

The majority of these first-time home buyers are a part of the millennial generation. A new report from Apartment List shows millennials are being deterred from home ownership by current market factors. To put this in perspective, the millennial homeownership rate is reported at 48.6% — more than 20% lower than Gen X and 30% lower than Baby Boomers. A staggering 22% of millennial renters say they will never own.

With time, interest rates will help lower home prices and moderate appreciation, but it may take longer for high-demand Sun Belt markets than other U.S. markets. Concentrated efforts by state officials have increased to create more market-rate and affordable inventory to help offset demand. But persisting supply chain constraints, labor shortages, and high costs for materials continue to put pressure on developers.

With so many millennials continuing to rent, the multifamily market remains attractive to investors. Multifamily transaction volume in Q1 2022 outpaced Q1 2021 significantly. However, the Fed’s planned schedule of gradual interest rate hikes has many believing a slowdown in deal flow will emerge in 2022.

Like the rest of the country, inflation continues to be a problem, but it is more severe in Phoenix. Phoenix leads all large cities in inflation at 11% CPI, making it tougher on longtime residents despite being a more affordable area relative to other markets.

Fortunately for investors, Phoenix is a top-tier multifamily market, lending credence that the Valley will not be hit as dramatically as other markets, specifically outside the Sun Belt region. The metro’s extremely favorable factors of continued population growth, low unemployment, wage growth, job growth, and vast talent pool favor this hypothesis.

Combine that with a low supply and high demand for rentals, given Phoenix’s housing market is unattainable by many first home buyers, rents are expected to continue to increase, and occupancy will remain high. In addition, with new companies continuing to target Phoenix for massive new headquarters and factories, more quality jobs and tax revenue are expected. It is fair to assume Phoenix will fare better, even in a possible recession, than most other multifamily markets."
116,"Thanks in part largely to the increase in mortgage rates due to the rate hikes announced by the Federal Reserve, the once very hot housing market in the United States has been experiencing a serious cooling off in recent months. There are many different signs of this cooling, but one of the more interesting factors is the growth in available for-sale inventory year over year, from 2021 to 2022. Based on monthly housing data from Redfin, we analyzed the 200 largest cities in the U.S. by population and zeroed-in on the change in available inventory from May 2021 to May 2022 (the latest data available at the date of publication).

Read on to find out which housing markets have experienced the biggest growth in available for-sale inventory over the last year.

10 Cities Where Housing Inventory Has Increased the Most in 2022

The 10 cities that have seen the largest growth in housing inventory from May 2021 to May 2022 are an interesting batch. There are some noticeable geographic patterns, with multiple Illinois cities, California cities, and Colorado cities ranking among the list of the top 10 cities. We ranked these 10 cities in order of the percentage growth in year-over-year housing inventory. Check out which cities made our list below.

1. Joliet, Illinois

Located to the southwest of Chicago, Joliet has witnessed a major growth in its housing inventory over the last year. For those wondering, is the housing market going to crash, it may be in Joliet. In May 2021, there was an available inventory of 163 homes for sale in Joliet, down from 314 homes in May 2020. This year, however, available inventory in Joliet is up by 188.3%: From 163 homes for sale in May 2021 to 470 homes in May 2022. This figure, 470 available homes for sale, is actually higher than Joliet’s housing inventory in May 2019, when it stood at 405. The number of home sales in Joliet has also leveled off, increasing by only 5.5%, from 220 home sales in May 2021 to 232 home sales in May 2022.

The median days a home spends on the market before going off market due to sale or pending sale has also increased substantially in Joliet. In May 2021, the median number of days on market for a home in Joliet was five days; a year later, in May 2022, the number of days on market grew by 760%, to a median of 43 days. This is longer than the median of 20 days on market in May 2020 and 14 days in May 2019.

2. Roseville, California

This large suburb of Sacramento has experienced a major growth in available inventory from 2021 to 2022, and the biggest increase in inventory of all the California housing markets in this study. Year over year, inventory in the Roseville housing market has grown by 132.7%: From 98 available homes for sale in May 2021 to 228 homes in May 2022. That’s a remarkable reversal of the trend in previous years, when housing inventory in Roseville continued to decline year after year. In May 2019, Roseville’s for-sale inventory was 355, before dropping to 278 homes in May 2020; it then dropped again to just 98 homes in May 2021. The May 2021 to May 2022 growth in Roseville’s housing inventory is the second largest in this study. At the same time, the number of home sales has declined. In May 2021, the Roseville housing market saw 228 home sales, before declining by 8.8%, to only 208 home sales in May 2022. The change in the median sale price in Roseville also reflects the slowdown in the housing market. In May 2021, the median sale price of a home in Roseville was $640,000, growing by 5.9% to reach $678,000 in May 2022. That’s a far cry from the increase in median sale price a year before, when Roseville’s median sale price grew by 36.5%, from $469,000 in May 2020 to $640,000 in May 2021.

3. Elk Grove, California

Elk Grove is another Sacramento suburb to make our list. From a for-sale inventory of only 81 homes in May 2021, Elk Grove’s housing inventory grew by 112.3% over the last year, reaching 172 homes available in May 2022. While an available inventory of 172 homes is less than May 2020’s 195 homes or May 2019’s 309 homes, the year-over-year increase in Elk Grove’s inventory is striking. The growth in home prices has also slowed in the Elk Grove housing market. From May 2020, when the median sale price was $440,000, it increased by 36.4% in a single year, reaching $600,000 in May 2021. However, from May 2021 to May 2022, Elk Grove’s median sale price only grew by 10.2%, from $600,000 to $661,250. Another important factor — sales-to-list ratio, the ratio of the sale price of a home to its listing price — has also declined over the last year. In May 2021, the sales-to-list price ratio in Elk Grove was 107.5%. Since then, its declined by 3.6%, down to a sales-to-list ratio of 103.7%; so, while homes are still selling for more than they’re being listed for in Elk Grove, the gap has decreased over the last year.

4. Aurora, Illinois

Here again we have an Illinois city making our list of the 10 cities where housing inventory has increased the most over the last year. Laying to the west of Chicago, Aurora has seen its housing inventory double in just one year: From 214 available homes for sale in May 2021, up to 428 homes in May 2022. This change is a stark reversal of the trend of the last three years, when year after year, the housing inventory in Aurora declined continuously: In May 2019, available inventory was 504 homes, before dropping to 364 homes in May 2020, and then dropping again to 214 homes in May 2021. The number of home sales in Aurora has also declined, from 242 home sales in May 2021, down 5.44%, to 229 home sales in May 2022. That year-over-year change is also quite different from the growth in the number of home sales from 152 sales in May 2020 to 242 home sales in May 2021. Another factor that’s reflecting the slowdown in the Aurora housing market is the median number of days on market. In May 2021, the median number of days a home spent on the market before being bought up was just six days. By May 2022, this number had grown by a staggering 616.7%, to a median of 43 days on market.

5. Lancaster, California

North of Los Angeles, in California’s Antelope Valley, the Lancaster housing market has seen its available inventory nearly double over the last year: From 202 available homes for sale in May 2021, up 95% to 394 homes in May 2022. Lancaster’s housing inventory in May 2022 is actually higher than it was in May 2020, when available for-sale inventory was 346. The number of home sales in Lancaster has also flatlined, going from 209 home sales in May 2021 to 209 home sales in May 2022. The change in home prices year-on-year is also striking in the Lancaster housing market. From a median sale price of $402,000 in May 2021, it grew by just 14.2%, reaching $459,000 in May 2022. Compare that one-year growth to the growth from May 2020 to May 2021: 30.9%, from a median sale price of $307,000 to $402,000.

6. Naperville, Illinois

Now we’re on our third Illinois city to make the list of the 10 cities where housing inventory has increased the most over the last year. Not far from Aurora, Naperville is another large Chicago suburb that’s witnessed a dramatic rise in its available housing inventory in 2022. From 278 available homes for sale in May 2021, inventory in Naperville jumped by 84.2% in the last year, reaching 512 available homes for sale in May 2022. Compare that one-year change in inventory to the pervious one-year period: From an inventory of 565 homes in May 2020, Naperville housing inventory was cut in half (-50.8%) over the course of the next year, falling to 278 homes available in May 2021.

The change in home prices has stayed relatively stable in Naperville. The median sale price in Naperville was $415,000 in May 2020, rose by 12.7% to reach $467,500 in May 2021, and then rose again, by 11.2%, to reach $520,000 in May 2022. However, home sales have declined noticeably, by 21.5%, since last year: From 312 home sales in May 2021 to 245 home sale in May 2022. What’s more, this Illinois city also witnessed one of the largest increases in the number of days a home spends on the market before being taken off. In May 2021, the median number of days on market for a home in Naperville was a mere five days; a year later, in May 2022, the number of days on market for a home soared by 740%, to a median of 42 days on the market.

7. Boise, Idaho

Boise became an especially hot housing market during the pandemic, due in part to West Coast residents buying up properties, most of them likely with jobs that could be performed remotely. But over the last year, the Boise housing market has seen its available inventory climb by 75.1%, from 333 homes for sale in May 2021 to 583 available homes in May 2022. That is quite a different year-over-year change than had happened between May 2020 to May 2021: Boise housing inventory dropped by 48.5%, from 646 available homes in May 2020 to 333 available homes in May 2021. Home prices have continued to rise in the Boise housing market, by 21.9%, from $480,000 in May 2021 to $585,000 in May 2022. However, this 21.9%, though solid, is almost half as fast as the growth (42%) in home prices from May 2020 ($338,000) to May 2021 ($480,000). Home sales in Boise also witnessed a decline, going from 413 home sales in May 2021, down 14% to reach 355 home sales in May 2022.

8. Aurora, Colorado

Yes indeed, there is another city named Aurora to make this list. A suburb outside of Denver that’s become a sizeable city in its own right, Aurora has seen its housing inventory increase over the last year by nearly three-quarters (74%): From an available inventory of 246 homes in May 2021 to an available inventory of 428 homes in May 2022. Home prices in Aurora have slowed their year-on-year growth a bit. From May 2020, the median sale price was $365,750, before rising by 20.8% to $442,000 in May 2021. After that, home prices still increased, but by 13.1%, from $442,000 in May 2021 to $500,000 in May 2022.

9. Thornton, Colorado

Thornton is the second of two Colorado cities to make this list of the housing markets where inventory has increased the most in 2022. The growth in Thornton’s available inventory is not far behind No. 8 Aurora’s: From an available inventory of 86 homes in May 2021, it rose by 70.9% in a single year, reaching a new available inventory of 147 homes. The build-up in housing inventory in Thornton may have been greater had not home sales managed to increase year over year. In May 2021, there were 227 home sales, which rose by 14.1%, to reach 259 home sales in May 2022. Home prices in the Thornton housing market have continued to rise, but at a slower pace from the previous one-year period. From May 2020, when the median sale price was $389,950, prices rose by 21.8% to reach a median sale price of $475,000 in May 2021; from there, prices increased by 16.8%, reaching a median sale price of $555,000 in May 2022.

10. Murfreesboro, Tennessee

The last city to make our list of the 10 major cities that have experienced the biggest increase in housing inventory is Murfreesboro. Over the last year, available inventory in the Murfreesboro housing market grew by just under two-thirds (60.6%): From an available inventory of 188 homes in May 2021, up to an inventory of 302 homes in May 2022. But while the increase in Murfreesboro’s housing inventory from May 2021 to May 2022 was the 10th largest in the study, the slashing in the city’s inventory from 2020 to 2021 was staggering. In May 2020, available inventory in Murfreesboro stood at 844 homes, from where it then dropped by an incredible 77.7% — meaning, more than three-quarters of available homes for sale disappeared from the market — reaching 188 homes in May 2021. Thus, while housing inventory is building up in Murfreesboro in 2022, it’s still way down from where it stood in May 2020 (844 homes) and May 2019 (904 homes).

The Bottom Line on “Is the Housing Market Going to Crash?”

When it comes to 2022 housing market predictions, only a few things can be said with some level of above-average confidence. The Colorado housing market has seen its major cities witness solid, double-digit-teens rates of growth in home prices from May 2021 to May 2022:

Thornton median sale price YOY growth: 16.8%
Lakewood median sale price YOY growth: 15.4%
Fort Collins median sale price YOY growth: 14.3%
Aurora median sale price YOY growth: 13.1%
Denver median sale price YOY growth: 11.4%

Compare all these year-over-year growth figures to the 15.1% May 2021-to-May 2022 rate for Colorado state overall; and against the 14.8% May 2021-to-May 2022 rate for the nation as a whole. Colorado’s year-over-year changes in median sale price closely mirrors national rates of change, with both the state of Colorado and the U.S. experiencing their highest price growth rates in May 2021 (24.7% for Colorado and 25.8% for the U.S. in median sale price growth from May 2020 to May 2021). Thus, when it comes to 2022 housing market predictions for Colorado, much of its housing activity will follow what goes on nationally. Changes in inventory year-over-year in Colorado closely follow national rates of annual change, both reaching their most recent highs in May 2022: Colorado experienced a 14.9% increase, and the U.S. experienced a 1.8% increase in their levels of housing inventory that month since May 2021.

When it comes to 2022 housing market predictions for the Illinois housing market, the trends are under heavy influence from longer-term developments — like the effects of deindustrialization still affecting Chicago and its surrounding area — as well as more immediate influences like in other states, such as the movement of the Millennial generation into homeownership, pandemic-induced swings and surge in demand, and the fed funds rate hikes in 2022, which have dampened the frenzy in most housing markets. Over the year from May 2021 to May 2022, the Illinois year-over-year growth in housing inventory was 27%, far in excess of the national average rate of 1.8%, but within range of Aurora’s 21.3% annual growth. Illinois home price growth year-over-year peaked at 20.1% in June 2021, a month after the national peak; year-over-year growth rates in home prices continued to mirror national trends, taking a dive for the next few months. But, where national year-over-year home price growth rates reached their low ebb in October 2021 at 13.1%, the Illinois year-over-year growth in median sale price that same month was a mere 4%, and it has stayed in the single digits ever since.

The California housing market includes many major cities, spread across a wide range of the state, so making any general 2022 housing market predictions about it are difficult. However, it is interesting that two of the California cities to make this list of housing markets with the biggest growth in inventory are in the Sacramento metro area. But the question remains: is the housing market going to crash? The housing market is unlikely to crash like it famously did in the 2007-2008 bursting of the housing bubble. For all the surge in demand and prices and dwindling of supply of homes in the last two years, the current housing market is very different than the market in the years of the lead-up to the housing bubble burst (2005 through 2007). Nowadays, NINJA loans (“no income, no job, and no assets”) are no longer getting dished out, with absurd loan-to-value ratios, to borrowers who clearly are not able to pay the mortgage on a home whose price is well beyond their means. And while adjustable-rate mortgages (ARARMs) are still popular, they, again, are not being shot out of a T-shirt cannon to completely unqualified borrowers like during the housing bubble of the mid-to-late-2000s. There are pessimists who say there’s no such thing as a “soft landing,” but it is likely that some housing markets will land more softly while others more harshly in the coming months, as rising mortgage rates put the squeeze on home affordability for many prospective buyers."
117,"WASHINGTON (TND) — The housing market is continuing to show signs of slowing down after operating at a blistering pace throughout the coronavirus pandemic as more people sought out space and took advantage of low-interest rates.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has made taming inflation a top priority for the U.S. central bank, leading to multiple rate hikes as policymakers try to cool off a demand that has outstripped supply and contributed to near record-high inflation.

Average interest rates for a 30-year mortgage were 5.81% for the week ending June 23, according to Freddie Mac data. Interest rates for 30-year mortgages were under 3% as recently as December.

The difference can mean hundreds of dollars extra for a monthly mortgage payment, making it too expensive for some people to afford in addition to dealing with inflation in other areas like food and gas.

Existing housing sales have fallen for three consecutive months, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales dropped 3.4% from April and are down 8.6% from last year.

""Home sales have essentially returned to the levels seen in 2019 – prior to the pandemic – after two years of gangbuster performance,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.

So far, the drop in demand has not led to a decrease in prices. The median sales price for an existing home was $407,600 in May, the first time it has been over $400,000 and an increase of nearly 15% from a year ago, according to NAR.

Taking some buyers out of the market may help prices stabilize moving forward as fewer bids come for homes on the market. It is a stark contrast from the last two years, where houses sold for essentially any list price with multiple competing offers.

Further sales declines should be expected in the upcoming months given housing affordability challenges from the sharp rise in mortgage rates this year,"" Yun said. ""Nonetheless, homes priced appropriately are selling quickly and inventory levels still need to rise substantially – almost doubling – to cool home price appreciation and provide more options for home buyers.""

Different segments of the market will be hit differently by rising interest rates based on what supply is available. The U.S. has struggled to maintain enough supply of homes, particularly at the entry level, for years.

Going forward different segments of the market will be impacted differently. Demand for entry level homes will likely remain strong as a lack of existing and new inventory is confronted with a potentially increasing pool of buyers,” said Jonathan Everett, assistant professor of practice for Virginia Tech’s Blackwood Program in Real Estate. “Therefore, I do not anticipate prices for entry level homes to decline anytime soon. However, I think we will see some stalling or slight reduction in prices among upper medium to higher priced homes as buyers are priced out due to rising interest rates.”
Building up the nation’s housing supply is one of the biggest factors in getting more affordable homes for purchase or rent. Increased interest rates also impact developers and builders, who have long struggled to keep up with demand.

As it gets more expensive for a builder to start and finish a project, some could pull back on their plans.

“As borrowing costs for homebuilders rise, expenses rise, requiring higher sales prices to maintain profit margins,” Everett said. “Simultaneously, as interest rates rise, borrower purchasing power erodes. Combine this with already rising material and labor costs, and homebuilders have to carefully evaluate the price range in which they can build and achieve a reasonable profit.

“This is all the more reason why I think building entry level homes is becoming increasingly more difficult.”

Those difficulties have started to be reflected in sentiment from home builders. The National Association of Home Builders index has fallen for six straight months, which shows a decline in confidence in the market. In June, the index was at 67 out of 100 — lower than it has been since the housing boom but still in line with historical averages.

It is nearly impossible to predict what the long-term future will look like for the housing market. Uncertainties about the economy, the war in Ukraine’s impact on inflation, how the supply chain responds to a pandemic recovery and a host of other issues make it difficult to estimate the long-term future.

“I do think the general consensus appears to be that demand is still greater than supply. In particular, I think the shortage of entry level housing should keep this specific market segment strong,” Everett said. “However, I do think we are bumping up against a resistance level for non-entry level homes and affordability at today’s prices may prove to be a growing concern.”"
118,"Rising mortgage rates due to the rate hikes implemented by the Federal Reserve have put the squeeze on home affordability for many American homebuyers, not to mention raising fears of an impending recession. The housing market in the United States really took off in the pandemic’s second year (2021), with high demand and homes flying off the shelves, leading to diminishing inventories and surges in home prices. With the recent increases in mortgage rates, many housing markets have showed reduced activity. Still, there are many housing markets that have continued to thrive.

Using monthly housing data from Redfin, we analyzed the 200 largest cities in the U.S. by population and determined which housing markets have experienced the biggest growth in home prices from May 2021 to May 2022 (the latest data available at the date of publication).

Read on to find out which housing markets have seen the price of their homes increase the most from 2021 to 2022.

10 Cities Where Home Prices Have Risen the Most 2021 to 2022

The 10 cities that have seen the largest growth in home prices from May 2021 to May 2022 are an interesting mix, though with some notable geographic patterns. Three cities in Nevada and three cities in Texas made this list of 10 major cities with the biggest rise in home prices over the last year. Other states that posted up cities to this list include California (Irvine), Florida (Hollywood), North Carolina (Cary), and Utah (Salt Lake City). Here’s a breakdown of the housing markets with the biggest increase in home prices from 2021 to 2022:

1. Waco, Texas

It is a testament to the robustness of the Texas housing market that Waco is one of three Texas cities to make our list of the 10 cities that have seen the biggest rise in home prices over the last year. Roughly halfway between Dallas and Austin, Waco has experienced an impressive 59.4% rise in home prices: From a median sale price of $155,000 in May 2021 to $247,000 in May 2022. Bear in mind, though, that this growth in home prices is more of a rebound than an outright increase. In May 2020, the median sale price in Waco was $252,556, before experiencing a massive drop, down to $155,000 the next May. New listings of homes for sale are also up since last year, from 11 new listings in May 2021 to 20 new listings in May 2022, a year-over-year increase of 81.8%.

2. Cary, North Carolina

Located just west of Raleigh, Cary has witnessed marked growth in its home prices from 2021 to 2022. Back in May 2021, the median sale price in Cary was $431,000, before rising by 42.7%, to reach $615,000 in May 2022. Homebuying demand is still high in Cary, with available inventory dropping by 28.2%, from 340 available homes in May 2021, down to 244 homes in May 2022. Another sign of activity in the Cary housing market is the continued rise in sales-to-list ratio, the ratio of what a home sells for compared to its listing price. In May 2020, the sales-to-list ratio in Cary was 99.2%, before rising to an impressive 105% in May 2021, and then rising again, to 109.5% in May 2022, meaning that the average home in Cary is selling for 9.5% above its list price.

3. McKinney, Texas

McKinney is another star of the Texas housing market in 2022. From a median sale price of $425,000 in May 2021, home prices in McKinney rose by 35.9%, reaching a new median price of $577,700 in May 2022. This one-year growth rate exceeds the one-year growth rate achieved from May 2020 to May 2021, when the median sale price in McKinney rose by 27.3%, from $333,750 to $425,000, respectively. Perhaps not surprisingly, housing inventory in McKinney has declined over the same period: From 336 available homes for sale in May 2021, down by 19.6%, to 270 available homes in May 2022. What’s more, the number of days a home in McKinney spends on the market before being bought up has remained quite short. From a median number of days on market of 43 days in May 2020, it fell by 65.1%, to just 15 days on market in May 2021; from there, it fell a tad more, to now just 14 days on market as of May 2022.

4. Salt Lake City, Utah

In the Utah housing market, Salt Lake City stands out, recording a year-over-year growth in home prices of 35.6%: From a median sale price of $450,000 in May 2021 to $610,000 in May 2022. Perhaps a reflection of the continued activity in the Salt Lake City housing market is the very few days a home spends on the market before being bought up. In May 2020, the median number of days on market for a home was 20 days; this then dropped to a median of eight days on market in May 2021 and only seven days on market in May 2022.

5. Enterprise, Nevada

Enterprise is the first of three Nevada cities to make this list. Situated right by Las Vegas, Enterprise saw its median sale price for a home rise by 35.1%: From a median of $385,000 in May 2021 to $520,000 in May 2022. The number of days on the market of a home for sale has remained low since 2020. In May 2021, the median number of days on market in Enterprise was 17 days and 19 days in May 2022. Homes in Enterprise are selling for above their listing price, with a sales-to-list ratio of 101.2% in May 2021 increasing to 101.4% in May 2022, whereas in May 2019 and May 2020 the figures were 98.3% and 98%, respectively.

6. Irvine, California

Irvine is the only city from the whole California housing market to make it in our list of the 10 cities that have seen the biggest rise in home prices from 2021 to 2022. From a median sale price of $989,000 in May 2021, home prices rose by 35%, reaching a median sale price of $1,335,000 in May 2022. Over the same period, the number of home sales fell by 31.4% (369 sales in May 2021 to 253 sales in May 2022), but inventory also fell. In May 2021, available inventory in Irvine was 457 homes, before dropping by 40.3%, to reach 273 homes in May 2022.

7. Frisco, Texas

Frisco is another sign of the strength of the Texas housing market. Home prices are up more than a third (33.8%) from last year: From a median sale price of $541,720 in May 2021 to $725,000 in May 2022. The number of days on market homes spend in Frisco being bought up has remained low, with a median number of days on market of 15 in May 2021 and 14 days in May 2022. Solid continued activity in the Frisco housing market is also reflected in the sales-to-list ratio. In May 2020, homes were selling for under their list price, with a sales-to-list ratio of 97.2% that month. From there, the sales-to-list price ratio surged to 106.3% in May 2021 and then even more, reaching 109.5% in May 2022, meaning a typical home in Frisco is selling for 9.5% over its listing price.

8. North Las Vegas, Nevada

North Las Vegas is the second of three Nevada cities to make this list. Home prices in North Las Vegas rose by a third (33.3%), from a median sale price of $330,000 in May 2021 to $440,000 in May 2022. Home sales are also up in North Las Vegas, which bucks the trend in so many other housing markets. Home sales rose by 1.6%, from 435 home sales in May 2021 to 442 home sales in May 2022. The number of days spent on the market for homes in North Las Vegas has held pretty steady: The median number of days on market was 11 in May 2021 and was 13 days in May 2022. And fortunately for homeowners of North Las Vegas, who recall the bursting of the housing bubble effect’s on Las Vegas real estate, a future slowdown in the Las Vegas housing market is unlikely to be anything like the great housing crash of the 2000s, according to KSNV news.

9. Hollywood, Florida

Florida is home to no state income taxes and an always-interesting housing market. Out of the entire Florida housing market, the city of Hollywood experienced the greatest increase in home prices over the last year. From a median sale price of $340,000 in May 2021, home prices rose by 33.1%, reaching a median price of $452,500 in May 2022. Not surprisingly, housing inventory in Hollywood is down, falling by 29.7%, from 1,089 available homes for sale in May 2021, down to 766 homes in May 2022. The number of days on the market before a house is bought up has decreased too in Hollywood. In May 2021, the median number of days on market for a home was 68 days, before falling to a median of 42 days on market in May 2022.

10. Paradise, Nevada

Paradise, Nevada, is the last city to make our list, experiencing a 33% rise in home prices since last year: From a median sale price of $300,000 in May 2021 to a median sale price of $399,000 in May 2022. That year-over-year growth of 33% far surpasses the year-over-year growth in home prices from May 2020 to May 2021, which saw home price growth of 10.7%, from $271,000 to $300,000. The number of home sales is down by 10.1% in Paradise, going from 406 home sales in May 2021, down to 365 home sales in May 2022. Meanwhile, the number of days on the market for a home in Paradise has continued to decline year after year since May 2019. In May 2021, the median days on market for a home in Paradise was 25 days, and it’s now down to a median of 20 days on market in May 2022.

The Bottom Line on Housing Market Prices

The national average rate of growth in home prices from May 2021 to May 2022 was 14.8%. Every single city in this list has experienced growth rates in home prices far in excess of that national average. The states with the most cities to make our top-10 list were Texas (with three cities) and Nevada (with three cities). For the state of Texas as a whole, the year-over-year growth in home prices was 19.5% for the same May-to-May period. Nevada’s annual growth rate in home prices was even higher, at 24.6%, rising from a medians sale price of $373,000 in May 2021 to $465,000 in May 2022. Thus, while much of the U.S. housing market has been displaying signs of cooling off, particularly in response to interest rate hikes, there are still plenty of housing markets where buying and selling activity is strong."
119,"As higher interest rates continue to squeeze spending power — and rising inflation shows no indication of slowing — Canadian home prices and sales will dip considerably, according to the nation’s largest lender.

TD Bank has officially downgraded their forecast for the housing market compared to their take in March, due to monetary policy tightening at a faster-than-expected rate. The Bank of Canada (BoC) has implemented three hikes to its trend-setting Overnight Lending Rate (OLR) since March, bringing the benchmark cost of borrowing to 1.5% from the record-low 0.25% it had hovered at throughout the pandemic. As consumer lenders base their Prime cost of borrowing on this rate, qualification thresholds and payments have risen markedly for variable mortgages and line of credit products.

TD expects the OLR to rise an additional 1.75% before the central bank finishes its hiking cycle, hitting a termination point of 3.25% by the last quarter of this year.

That’s going to continue to weigh heavily on housing activity, says the bank, which now forecasts a 33% “peak-to-trough” decline in Canadian home sales from Q1 2022 to Q1 2023, before buying activity starts to stabilize. In all, sales will drop 23% on an annual basis this year, and 12% next. 

That will result in a 19% drop in average home prices over the same time frame. “However,” states TD’s release, home prices are “likely to grow modestly thereafter, alongside some recovery in demand.”

According to the Canadian Real Estate Association, national home sales have cooled rapidly since the BoC’s first hike, with activity dropping 21.7% year over year, and 8.6% month over month, in May. Prices fell 4.6% from April to an average of $711,116; more than a $100,000-decline from the price peak recorded in February.

TD expects the largest price drops will be felt in Ontario and British Columbia, as home value return closer to fundamentals following “significant affordability deteriorations during the pandemic,” while Quebec will see price growth, though modest, following its own price run up in early 2020.

The Prairie provinces, however, are set for a considerable correction. In Alberta, “sales are expected to retrench significantly from their record highs. However, they should remain closer to pre-pandemic levels than either B.C. and Ontario through 2023, supporting tighter markets and stronger price growth.” 

The ‘wild rose’ province has experienced a dramatic uptick in demand over the last couple of years, popular with both investors and end-user homebuyers for its relatively lower average home price, compared to Canada’s other large urban centres; benchmark home prices in Calgary and Edmonton are in the $400,000 – $600,000 range, in contrast to over $1.2M in Greater Toronto and Greater Vancouver.

Other Canadian provinces, however, can expect a smoother ride given their overall better affordability conditions; strong population growth and a tight sellers’ market in the Atlantic provinces will support local prices, though rising rates could make a dent moving forward."
120,"Seattle lags behind other metro areas when it comes to building new homes, per the latest analysis by real estate company Redfin.

What they found: The city issued 6.5 single-family building permits per 10,000 people in the first quarter of this year, the 30th-most per capita among major U.S. metros.

Why it matters: As the number of homes for sale remains near all-time lows and monthly mortgage payments are near their record high, building more homes is one way to ease the affordability crisis.

Zoom out: Single-family and multifamily building permits are up from pre-pandemic in most U.S. metros., Redfin found.

Of note: Redfin defines ""single-family"" as buildings with one to four housing units and ""multifamily"" as buildings with five or more housing units.
Yes, but: ""There still aren't enough homes to meet the pace of household creation, and we need to be more prepared when demand inevitably picks back up,"" said Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather.

The bottom line: Ramping up new home construction will help move the market toward balance, if only a little."
121,"WASHINGTON (TND) — The housing market is continuing to show signs of slowing down after operating at a blistering pace throughout the coronavirus pandemic as more people sought out space and took advantage of low-interest rates.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has made taming inflation a top priority for the U.S. central bank, leading to multiple rate hikes as policymakers try to cool off a demand that has outstripped supply and contributed to near record-high inflation.

Average interest rates for a 30-year mortgage were 5.81% for the week ending June 23, according to Freddie Mac data. Interest rates for 30-year mortgages were under 3% as recently as December.

The difference can mean hundreds of dollars extra for a monthly mortgage payment, making it too expensive for some people to afford in addition to dealing with inflation in other areas like food and gas.

Existing housing sales have fallen for three consecutive months, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales dropped 3.4% from April and are down 8.6% from last year.

""Home sales have essentially returned to the levels seen in 2019 – prior to the pandemic – after two years of gangbuster performance,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.

So far, the drop in demand has not led to a decrease in prices. The median sales price for an existing home was $407,600 in May, the first time it has been over $400,000 and an increase of nearly 15% from a year ago, according to NAR.

Taking some buyers out of the market may help prices stabilize moving forward as fewer bids come for homes on the market. It is a stark contrast from the last two years, where houses sold for essentially any list price with multiple competing offers.

Further sales declines should be expected in the upcoming months given housing affordability challenges from the sharp rise in mortgage rates this year,"" Yun said. ""Nonetheless, homes priced appropriately are selling quickly and inventory levels still need to rise substantially – almost doubling – to cool home price appreciation and provide more options for home buyers.""

Different segments of the market will be hit differently by rising interest rates based on what supply is available. The U.S. has struggled to maintain enough supply of homes, particularly at the entry level, for years.

Going forward different segments of the market will be impacted differently. Demand for entry level homes will likely remain strong as a lack of existing and new inventory is confronted with a potentially increasing pool of buyers,” said Jonathan Everett, assistant professor of practice for Virginia Tech’s Blackwood Program in Real Estate. “Therefore, I do not anticipate prices for entry level homes to decline anytime soon. However, I think we will see some stalling or slight reduction in prices among upper medium to higher priced homes as buyers are priced out due to rising interest rates.”
Building up the nation’s housing supply is one of the biggest factors in getting more affordable homes for purchase or rent. Increased interest rates also impact developers and builders, who have long struggled to keep up with demand.

As it gets more expensive for a builder to start and finish a project, some could pull back on their plans.

“As borrowing costs for homebuilders rise, expenses rise, requiring higher sales prices to maintain profit margins,” Everett said. “Simultaneously, as interest rates rise, borrower purchasing power erodes. Combine this with already rising material and labor costs, and homebuilders have to carefully evaluate the price range in which they can build and achieve a reasonable profit.

“This is all the more reason why I think building entry level homes is becoming increasingly more difficult.”

Those difficulties have started to be reflected in sentiment from home builders. The National Association of Home Builders index has fallen for six straight months, which shows a decline in confidence in the market. In June, the index was at 67 out of 100 — lower than it has been since the housing boom but still in line with historical averages.

It is nearly impossible to predict what the long-term future will look like for the housing market. Uncertainties about the economy, the war in Ukraine’s impact on inflation, how the supply chain responds to a pandemic recovery and a host of other issues make it difficult to estimate the long-term future.

“I do think the general consensus appears to be that demand is still greater than supply. In particular, I think the shortage of entry level housing should keep this specific market segment strong,” Everett said. “However, I do think we are bumping up against a resistance level for non-entry level homes and affordability at today’s prices may prove to be a growing concern.”"
122,"It’s easy to conclude from the craziness of New York City’s rental market — including that long line for a tiny, rent-regulated East Village apartment that made The Post’s cover — that what the city needs is more “affordable housing.”

But it’s not true. Not only do New York City and the state overall have more subsidized housing than anywhere else in the nation — we make inefficient use of such housing. And rent regulation is actually helping drive the scarcity and sky-high rents of other units.

To be sure, the sight of wannabe renters waiting more than an hour in hopes of snagging a 371-square-foot, one-bedroom, third-floor walk-up for $2,337 a month would be inconceivable in most of America. Consider that the median mortgage payment in Phoenix is just $1,500 a month — for 2,500 square feet. It’s no wonder the city is losing population to the Sunbelt.

But to conclude that Gotham’s rental market needs more “affordable” — that is, income-restricted — units ignores reality.

New York state has 490,000 subsidized-housing units, the most in the country, per the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, with some 359,000 units in the city. With 5% of the nation’s population, New York has 10% of directly subsidized housing units — including public housing; housing choice vouchers for individual households renting private units; and rental units in buildings whose construction costs have been subsidized by the federal Low Income Housing Tax credit, which requires a percentage of units be set aside for rental by low- and moderate-income households as defined by median area income.

That staggering number doesn’t even include the more than 1 million rent-stabilized units, whose owners must keep rents low no matter tenant income.

Both directly subsidized and rent-regulated apartments provide good deals for lucky tenants — but wildly distort the overall housing market. A New York University study of New York City rent-regulated units found that 23% of tenants had moved in more than 20 years ago, three times as long a period as in market-rate units. In core Manhattan, fully 30% of rent-regulated tenants had lived in their apartments 20 years or more.

Low turnover means that renters of units that might go on the market in other cities — as older tenants no longer need the space and want to limit their costs — have an incentive to stay put. So newcomers to the city — including those who might have been waiting in the long East Village line — are out of luck.

This isn’t a housing market — it’s a game of apartment musical chairs.

Lucky winners hit what amounts to the housing lottery — a low-rent apartment without time limit. The same is true for those who score a designated new construction “affordable unit,” for which rent regulation kicks in. A change in income doesn’t affect the rent in these units. Tenants could literally hit the state lottery number and see limited rent increases at best from the Rent Guidelines Board, which votes yearly on increases to rent-stabilized units. To say this is an inefficient use of scarce public resources is an understatement.

The public-housing system is no better. HUD reports that 30% of New York City Housing Authority tenants are “overhoused” — meaning they have more bedrooms than they need — even as long waiting lists are the norm. Again there’s no incentive to move so long as one has an artificially cheap apartment.

There are some commonsense solutions. NYCHA could offer buyouts to tenants with extra bedrooms — to make way for homeless families. High-income tenants could be disqualified from rent-stabilized units. Or better still, the whole crazy quilt of rent regulation could be swept away — making New York more like other cities, where housing is not a perennial crisis.

Instead, Gov. Kathy Hochul is pushing for an additional $25 billion in subsidized housing.  Incredibly, the cost of building tax-subsidized affordable units in New York state tops $400,000 — per apartment. That’s thanks to union-dictated prevailing wage laws and the high cost for developers, who must negotiate zoning regulations and political demands.

If housing subsidies were the path to prosperity and widespread affordability, New York state would long ago have achieved both. Instead, it has demonstrated that even the most extensive housing-subsidy program in the nation guarantees neither."
123,"Long waits by dozens of people to view tiny apartments that go to the highest bidder: Hunting for a New York City rental is an exquisite form of agony these days. 

A year ago, bidding wars for rentals were unheard of, now renters expect to offer above the asking rent. The increasingly desperate situation for renters has prompted some to consider unique ways to give their application an edge with landlords and brokers—like free meals and even one offer of fancy cheese—to sweeten the deal. 

Of course, not everyone is giving freebies to brokers but if you plan on moving to the city or your lease ends in the next few months, you’re probably nervous and wondering when rents will go down or at least level off. Brick asked brokers and real estate experts to weigh in on when that will be. 

Let’s start with what’s keeping rents high: Lots of demand and few available apartments. For rents to start falling, you’d need to see “a sustained lack of demand,” says Noah Rosenblatt, co-founder and CEO of real estate analytics firm UrbanDigs. 

The other factor would be more apartments becoming available—or in broker-speak, “more inventory.” Michael J. Franco, a broker at Compass, says, “The lack of inventory is what has driven prices up, especially at certain price points.” 

Are there signs of slowing demand? 
No, there are no signs of slowing demand, in fact, we are just heading into the rental market’s busiest season. Jonathan Miller, president and CEO of appraisal firm Miller Samuel, says that will keep rents high in the short term. “New leasing activity each year peaks in August so there are still three more months of rising demand,” he says. 

Many New Yorkers left the city as the pandemic closed businesses for months in 2020 but that trend began reversing after Covid vaccines became widely available. Now data from moving companies finds that more people are moving to NYC than before the pandemic. 

Since February 2021, Brick Underground has featured first-person accounts of people moving to NYC for the first time. Whether it’s for the big city vibe or to embrace a new life chapter, there’s no shortage of newcomers. A year ago, many were taking advantage of lower rents, now they’re moving to the city in spite of them.

“Two thirds of the office towers are empty and yet we are having the highest apartment leasing activity and record rents,” Miller says. This seems counterintuitive but suggests people moving to the city aren’t just coming for work. “Remote work gives many people the option to be in the city and work somewhere else,” Miller says.

So with the rental market currently following the fundamental principles of supply and demand, Rosenblatt says there’s no signs of rents dipping in coming months.

How the sales market also affects the rental market
There's more competition for rental apartments in NYC when co-op and condo sales slow. That's happening now: Rising mortgage rates are making it more expensive to buy and slowing down the sales market as a result. Many would-be buyers who are priced out of the market typically decide to rent (or keep renting) instead, increasing demand for rentals. 

“There has been at least a 50 percent drop in affordability on mortgage rates alone,” Miller says. As the cost of borrowing rises, so does the cost of buying. That means people who might have left their rentals to move into a place they’ve bought are, instead, staying put. 

In addition, the financial uncertainty of the past few years has mortgage lenders being conservative when it comes to who they will lend to. Buyers who can’t qualify stay in the rental market. “Current underwriting is tighter than long term norms and so you have a greater move towards rentals for people who don’t quality anymore,” Miller says. 

All this, he says, is “exacerbating an already tight market” for rentals. 

Are there signs of more apartments being available soon?
A lack of affordable apartments is an ongoing issue for the city. The data from New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey pointed to an extreme vacancy shortage among the city’s lowest-cost units: In 2021, the number of available apartments with rents below $1,500 was at its lowest in 30 years.

Franco says, at the moment, it’s currently difficult to find two- or three-bedroom apartment listings in Upper Manhattan and there are shortages altogether in some neighborhoods—like the West Village. 

Most of the rental buildings built in New York over the past decade or more are skewed to the upper half of the market. And that’s because land costs and construction costs are high, and developers need to earn enough to balance their costs. Miller points out this is in line with national trends. So while there are record high rents at the top of the market, there are also rising rents on more affordable apartments because fewer of these types of buildings are coming to the market—buildings designed to attract lower-paying renters. 

Why are some NYC apartments still vacant? Some theories
Rosenblatt also claims thousands of rent-stabilized apartments are just sitting empty—the real estate term for this warehousing.

If it sounds improbable, you have to go back to 2019 when changes to the rent laws in New York made it much more difficult for landlords to cycle their apartments out of the rent-stabilization program. Remember, rent stabilization is part of the city's attempts to preserve affordable housing and getting one of these apartments is like hitting the jackpot for a NYC tenant—you get automatic lease renewals and annual rent increases capped at percentages approved by the Rent Guidelines Board (even if that agency just approved the biggest increases in a decade).

Landlords were furious when they found they could no longer deregulate their apartments and charge higher rents by doing major renovations or reaching a rent threshold that turned the apartment into a market-rate one. ""Landlords are hoping there will be a new administration to come in and reverse this law,"" Rosenblatt says. (All the more reason to use your vote this election cycle.)

It's very difficult to move a tenant out of a rent-stabilized apartment so it’s possible some landlords just haven't rented the apartments out. Miller says this is an “interesting premise” but isn’t sure how this data is gathered or quantified. It would have to come from landlords sharing their portfolios, data that’s difficult to come by. 

It’s anecdotal, but Adam Frisch, senior managing director at Mantus Real Estate, says he’s had at least 20 or 25 rent-stabilized apartments over the past two years where a tenant has left and the landlord kept the place vacant or rented it to a friend or family member rather than put it back on the market. He says this is “contributing to the lack of supply,” and identifies this being a bigger issue in the Bronx, eastern parts of Brooklyn, and Queens than in Manhattan. 

Rosenblatt says the warehoused apartments are in walk-ups and prewar elevator buildings north of 96th Street in Manhattan and then distributed more evenly in various other neighborhoods.

Another factor keeping apartments off the market, Frisch says, is tighter regulations for lead paint inspection as a result of changes to Local Law 66. He estimates 30 percent of the apartments in his portfolio are currently off the market—at peak season—as landlords do multiple lead paint tests and remediation to pass more rigorous inspections. 

“There are probably thousands of apartments now that are not hitting the market just as demand is at its highest and supply is at its lowest,” he says, and he thinks tenants should know this is contributing to keeping rents high.

What about inflation—how does that affect rents?
Just as the costs of goods and services go up when inflation is high, so too do rents. ""Landlords want to see and equal their return on their investment, which may be decreasing with inflation causing an increase in rent prices,"" Franco says. 

However, Rosenblatt points to factors affecting the bigger picture beyond the NYC rental market—including rising inflation and potential layoffs in the tech sector—as the kind of recessionary factors that might bring rents down. ""Nothing goes in a straight line forever,"" he says.

Frisch’s outlook for the economy is far from rosy—he expects lease breaks and more apartment availability as layoffs happen. “This is going to come down, this is not sustainable,” he says. 

As to when this might happen, Miller says barring a significant recession event, he doesn’t see “a lot of relief in rents going forward.”"

125,"SAN DIEGO – As the calendar flips to summer, rent prices appear to be falling in San Diego in a trend seen in markets throughout the U.S., according to a new report from the online rental platform Zumper.

The median rent price for a one-bedroom in June was $2,320 and it was $2,910 for a two-bedroom, both marking a 6.1% dip from last month, the report shows. Prices for both are still up double digits from the same time last year, but data from the platform indicates markets may be cooling amid a period of national economic disruption.

San Diego was listed among Zumper’s top five fallers in June along with Tallahassee, Florida, Anchorage, Alaska, Urban Honolulu, Hawaii and Syracuse, New York.

“With an unpredictable stock market, the ever-increasing cost of living, ongoing war in Ukraine, and talk of a recession, many consumers are tightening their wallets and reconsidering their living arrangements yet again,” the report reads.

In the U.S., rent prices were up half of a percent from May and down nearly 3% for two-bedrooms, which the report notes is “a sign that rent hikes are beginning to slow.” The most expensive market continues to be New York City, which saw its median price at $3,600 for a one-bedroom and $3,950 for a two-bedroom.

Six of the 10 most expensive markets for a one-bedroom were in California, according to the report, including San Diego which was the seventh most expensive market for one-bedrooms.

See how other California cities charted in the Zumper report, sorted by the median price of a one-bedroom:

Analysts also see the housing market slowing with listed homes available for longer periods of time, prompting price reductions. In June, FOX 5 real estate expert Ken Kaplan acknowledged the market cooldown, saying he’s seen a steady shift in the past several months.

“Homes are receiving one or two offers instead of 20 and not going over asking price, but maybe at asking price,” Kaplan told FOX 5’s Kasia Gregorczyk.

Kaplan said it effectively creates a new dynamic at both ends of the market. For potential buyers, “the ball may be back in their court” in terms of negotiations while potential sellers may consider putting their home on the market because of their appreciation value, he said."
126,"Getting a mortgage can be hard enough when you have a full-time job. If you’re currently unemployed, things can be even more difficult, but not necessarily impossible.

You Will Need to Show a Steady Source of Income
If you want to take out a mortgage, you will have to show a lender that you’ll be able to keep up with the monthly payments. Usually, borrowers provide pay stubs showing their earnings, but that’s not the only possible source of income you can use to buy a home. 

You won’t be able to buy a house with unemployment benefits alone since that’s a short-term source of income. If, however, you receive regular income from investments, Social Security, a lawsuit settlement, alimony, or another source, you might qualify for a mortgage. 

You Might Be Able to Buy a House With Another Person’s Income
Someone else’s income might be enough to help you secure a mortgage. If you want to buy a house to share with a spouse or a partner and that person has a stable source of income that can cover a mortgage and other bills, the two of you might be able to qualify for a loan, even if you’re currently out of work.

Another option is to get an individual who won’t be living in the house to cosign a loan. For example, you might have a parent, sibling or friend who is willing to assume financial responsibility for a mortgage so you can buy a house now. 

That’s a big ask, so don’t be surprised if your loved one says no. If you don’t find a job and can’t cover the mortgage payments yourself, the cosigner will continue to be responsible for your loan. Your relatives and friends have their own bills to pay and their own families to care for, and they might not be willing to assume that financial risk.

You Might Get Approved If You Will Be Employed in the Near Future
If you have received a job offer, but you haven’t begun working yet, you might be able to qualify for a mortgage based on an offer letter. It will need to show how much you will earn and whether you will be paid hourly or will receive a salary.

If you have a seasonal job or you work as a contractor and you’re currently unemployed, but you expect work to resume soon, you might be able to get a home loan. A lender will look at your average income, and you might have to meet stringent guidelines.

A Mortgage Lender Will Consider Your Whole Financial Picture
When evaluating applications, lenders look at a lot more than just income. A borrower’s debt-to-income ratio and credit score are critically important. If you have little or no debt and a high credit score, as well as income from a source other than a job or plans to return to work soon, a lender might approve your application for a home loan, even if you’re currently unemployed."

The good news is that there are plenty of ways to save money when updating your bathroom. From sticking to a basic layout to taking a DIY approach when installing fixtures, here are 11 ways to save on your bathroom renovation.

Stick to a Basic Layout

""If you're working with a small bathroom, one of the best ways to save money is to stick to a basic layout,"" said Shaun Martin, owner and CEO of Denver Real Estate Solutions. ""Don't try to move plumbing or make major changes to the layout of the room, as this can add significant costs to the project.""

Reuse What You Can

""When it comes to saving money on a bathroom renovation, one of the best things you can do is reuse as many of your existing fixtures and fittings as possible,"" said Martin. ""If your bathroom cabinets, vanities and toilets are still in good condition, reuse them.""

Spend Time Doing Product and Brand Research

John Bodrozic, co-founder of HomeZada, said bathroom materials come in so many different options and price points, so it's wise to do your homework.

""As an example, high-end plumbing fixtures cost a lot more than entry-level or mid-range priced products. This is the key to saving money because you are balancing what products and brands you like versus what products and brands you can afford. If you go with all high-end products, your bathroom remodel could be $15 to $20k. Entry-level product choices can get you down to $5 to $7k.""

Consider Your Flooring Carefully

""The type of flooring you choose for your bathroom can have a big impact on both the look and the cost of the renovation,"" said Martin. ""If you're on a tight budget, laminate or vinyl flooring are good options that will give you the look of more expensive materials like stone or tile without the price tag. If you're willing to spend a bit more, ceramic or porcelain tile are attractive and durable choices for bathroom flooring. Natural stone floors are also beautiful, but can be very expensive.""

Get Creative With Storage

""One way to save money on your bathroom renovation is to get creative with storage,"" Martin said. ""If you don't need fancy built-in cabinetry, consider using open shelves or even repurposed furniture pieces for storage. This can add character to your space and save you money on the overall renovation.""

Shop on Amazon

""We buy everything possible on Amazon when we are renovating bathrooms including new faucets, new fixtures and any type of hardware such as cabinetry and items like towel bars,"" said Jeff Shipwash, owner and founder of Shipwash Properties LLC.

""Buying these items on Amazon versus a big-box store, such as Lowe's, saves us hundreds of dollars.""

""Most areas have special warehouses that sell building materials,"" said Shipwash. ""My favorite thing to search for at these places are vanities with expensive tops. These are usually discounted because they have a small scratch or knick. We can never tell what the issue is and always save over 40% on a brand new vanity and top.""

Be Smart About Shower Replacements

""When renovating the shower, you can use a fiberglass basin instead of tile,"" said Mike Otranto of Wake County Home Buyers. ""This should save at least $800 depending on your market.

Refinish the Tub

""Refinish/reglaze fiberglass tubs instead of replacing them,"" advised Otranto. ""There are vendors who can do this and put a lifetime warranty on the work (don't let anyone tell you it can't be done, as I do it regularly).""

Install Fixtures Yourself

Melanie Hartmann, owner of Creo Home Buyers in Maryland, said that if you are updating your faucets and showerhead there's probably a video online that will walk you through the installation of your exact model.

""Most plumbers charge at least $100 or more to replace a single sink faucet, and that's mostly just to cover the drive to and from your home,"" she said. ""So if you're replacing your faucets and showerhead, try doing it yourself first.""

Get Several Bids on Your Project

""Getting three different bids from three different qualified contractors is also a way to save money,"" said Bodrozic. ""Contractors have different workloads and different overhead to run their business, so you end with different price points. But don't make the decision purely based on the price, because you want to validate their previous work with customer references and check contractor and insurance licenses."""
128,"Homebuyers of single-family homes in metro Richmond paid an average of 8% more than the original list price in April and May, up from an average of 5.5% over asking the same time last year.

That's the highest ratio of list-to-sale price in recent history, according to an Axios analysis of data from the Richmond Association of Realtors.
Why it matters: Over-asking home sales prices are a sign of a tight and competitive market, and while the number of home sales in Richmond and the state shows signs that demand is cooling, that hasn't translated into lower home prices.

""In fact, [home prices] continue to climb rapidly. The statewide median sales price in May 2022 was $401,082, which jumped up 8.7% from last May, a gain of more than $32,000,"" the Virginia Association of Realtors wrote in its most recent report.
In metro Richmond, the median sale price for a single-family home hit $390,000 in May, an 18% year-over-year increase.

What's happening: In the last 120 days, 4,337 single-family homes closed in Richmond, Chesterfield, and Henrico — 3,380 of them, or more than three-quarters, for over asking, Adam McEwen, with the Central Virginia MLS, tells Axios.

The intrigue: While 8% is the average over asking, some people are paying even more. Since last January, 157 homes in metro Richmond sold for 40% or more over the original list price, meaning buyers are sometimes offering $60,000 — or even $500,000 — above asking in their desperation to secure a home.

Zoom in: Homes sold at auction — often marked as ""investor specials"" — are the biggest driver of the trend, Axios' analysis shows.

The opening auction bid for this house in the Manchester High School district in Chesterfield was set for $99,000. It sold in September for $165,000 and then hit the market again two months later, freshly renovated, for $285,000 (it sold for the second time in fall 2021 for $287,000).

This midcentury-influenced, good-bones Battery Hill Drive house in Henrico, happens to sit on a 5-acre lot on the James River, just a stone's throw from the Lily Pad. It listed in December for $250,000 and sold at auction a month later for $522,500.

Then there are the million-dollar homes:

A five-bedroom home in the Near West End was listed for $1,199,000 — and sold for $1,805,000.
This six-bedroom in Windsor Farms — with an au pair suite and garden house — listed for $1,250,000 and sold for $2,000,000."
129,"Misunderstandings regarding rising interest rates are creating anxiety and stoking uncertainty amongst Canadian homeowners and prospective buyers, a new survey shows.

The TD Real Estate survey found that 26% of Canadians don’t have a good understanding of the impact of rising rates, while 38% are confused about what the hikes mean for them. Nearly 40% don’t know the difference between variable and fixed interest rates.

Thirty-one per cent of respondents believe that interest rates don’t impact them or their mortgage.

Conducted between May 20 and 25, the national survey included responses from 2,000 Canadians aged 18 and older.

“Rising interest rates affect all Canadians, especially those who are looking to become homebuyers in the near future, and those up for renewal,” said Frank Psoras, senior vice president of real estate secured lending at TD.

Despite the uncertainty brought on by rising interest rates, 58% of current homeowners expect to take some form of action with their property within the next year. Forty-two per cent plan to renovate, while 13% are likely to sell.

The survey found that many prospective buyers are willing to compromise to get into the housing market. Twenty-six per cent said they’d give up on the overall size of a home in order to make a purchase, while 29% said they’d sacrifice outdoor space.

Of those who are hoping to buy a home in the next year, 76% say they are worried about the impact that rising rates will have on what they can afford, while 27% admitted to not knowing or understanding many of the costs associated with buying a home.

“In today’s dynamic market, understanding the impact of rising interest rates is critical to establishing and maintaining financial health, regardless of where you are on your home journey,” Psoras said.

Psoras encouraged current and prospective buyers alike to meet with a mortgage specialist or financial adviser to get a clear picture of what they can afford and make sense of the “complex and evolving” real estate market."
130,"Hamilton has long been a destination for those looking for a cost-effective alternative to Toronto that is still in close proximity to it. However, with real estate markets across Ontario exploding since the pandemic, as they did in other GTHA markets, Hamilton house prices broke new records, and the average price for a home surpassed the $1 million mark.

The latest numbers show a cooling in Hamilton (and many other Ontario markets), with the number of sales and house prices dropping. Competition still remains fierce for a Hamilton home, however, so when you’re ready to make an offer, hire a real estate lawyer in Hamilton who is available at your convenience and can move quickly.

If you’re considering a move to Hamilton, below is some useful information you’ll need to know before going in.

Location, Location, Location
Hamilton is located in southern Ontario, in the middle of the Golden Horseshoe. It’s approximately a 75- minute drive from Toronto and less than two hours from the Canadian-American border at Niagara Falls.

It sits on the shores of Lake Ontario and has an extensive coastline with many conservation areas and outdoor activity centres. Access to both city life and nature is a common theme in Hamilton

Hamilton’s Job Market
Forever known as Steeltown, manufacturing still plays a starring role in Hamilton’s economy. However, Hamilton’s economy is evolving and now includes other job markets such as construction, life sciences, healthcare, education, agribusiness and tech. In fact, Hamilton recently experienced a 53% growth in its tech sector thanks to investments from companies like Amazon, IBM and Nokia.

Education
The Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board consists of 99 schools serving 50,000 students. Hamilton is also home to world-renowned McMaster University and other respected post-secondary institutions like McMaster Divinity College and Mohawk College.

Transportation
Many areas in Hamilton are within reasonable distance of two major highways, the QEW and the 403. As with most downtown areas, driving around and finding parking in downtown Hamilton can get frustrating. Thankfully, Hamilton’s public transportation service, lovingly referred to by locals as the “Hamilton Street Railway”(HSR)as an homage to the old streetcar system, has over 40 routes. There are also two GO Stations located in the downtown core, with more routes planned to connect through East Hamilton, Stoney Creek, Grimsby, St. Catharines, and Niagara Falls.

Hamilton Weather
As in most other Canadian cities, winters in Hamilton get long and cold. However, thanks to Lake Ontario, they are generally milder than in other parts of Canadian. Hamilton typically reaches temperatures at or below freezing for 129 days out of the year, but the average temperature rarely drops below -10°C.

Summers in Hamilton make up for the winters as they are warm, with an average July temperature of 22°C. But they also get humid, and you’ll rely heavily on your air conditioner between June and September."
131,"BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA – Rising mortgage interest rates, high inflation, and still-tight inventory levels were factors influencing Brevard’s housing market in May, with fewer closed sales compared to a year ago.

“Inventory has remained at a very low level for some time, which means we’re still deep in seller’s market territory. But we’re starting to see some progress back toward a balanced market,” said Jennifer McCoy with McCoy Freeman Real Estate, which serves all of Florida’s Space Coast.

The countywide median sales price for single-family existing homes in May was $375,000, up 29.3% from the previous year.

Last month’s countywide median price for condo-townhouse units was $300,000, up 29.2% over the year-ago figure.

This year rising mortgage rates continued to depress sales of existing Space Coast homes in May. This slowdown in the rate of sales was accompanied by an increase in the rate of homes listed for sale in May.

New listings of single-family homes were up on a year-over-year basis by over 23.5%—the largest such increase since August of last year. New listings of townhouses and condos were up more modestly, by 7.5%.

These are large increases in inventory, of course, but we started from a very low level. We are still only at about 1.1 months’ supply of inventory, which means we are still deep in the seller’s market territory. But we are starting to make some progress back toward a balanced market.

As more inventory continues to come online, we will be looking closely at prices for signs of a moderation in their rate of growth.

According to Freddie Mac, the interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.23% in May, significantly higher than the 2.96% average during the same month a year earlier.

A quick recap of the Brevard County Residential Report for May 2022:
